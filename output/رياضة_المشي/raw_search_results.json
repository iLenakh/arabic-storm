A systematic review of 63 studies found that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation improved cardiovascular function. These studies consisted of various forms of aerobic exercise at a range of intensities (from 50 to 95% VO2), over a multitude of time periods (1\u201347 months). Overall, exercise significantly reduced CVD-related mortality, decreased risk of MI, and improved quality of life. Another study looked specifically at patients with atherosclerosis post-revascularization surgery. Patients who underwent 60 min of exercise per day on a cycle ergometer for 4 weeks had an increased blood flow reserve (29%) and improved endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. A recent study provided personalized aerobic exercise rehabilitation programs for patients who had an acute myocardial infarction for 1 year after a coronary intervention surgery", "Exercise has a similar effect on cardiovascular improvements in lean and overweight normoglycemic subjects. In a 1-year study of non-obese individuals, a 16\u201320% increase in energy expenditure (of any form of exercise) with no diet intervention resulted in a 22.3% decrease in body fat mass and reduced LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol/HDL ratio, and C-reactive protein concentrations, all risk factors associated with CVD. In overweight individuals, 7\u20139 months of low-intensity exercise (walking ~19 km per week at 40\u201355% VO2peak) significantly increased cardiorespiratory fitness compared to sedentary individuals. Together these data indicate that exercise interventions decrease the risk or severity of CVD in subjects who are lean, obese, or have type 2 diabetes.\nCardiac rehabilitation", "[edit]Exercise increases the chances of surviving cancer. If one exercises during the early stages of cancer treatment it may allow time to reduce the detrimental side effects of the chemotherapy. It also improves physical functions along with reducing distress and fatigue. Studies have shown that exercise has the possibility to improve the chemotherapy drug uptake, thanks to the increase in peripheral circulation. This also makes changes to tumor vasculature from the increase of cardio and blood pressure.\nStroke", "- ^ Garcia L, Pearce M, Abbas A, Mok A, Strain T, Ali S, et al.

However, it has now been shown that a monitored rehabilitation program using moderate-intensity exercise is safe for heart failure patients, and this has now become an important therapy for patients with heart failure. Meta-analyses and systemic reviews have shown that exercise training in heart failure patients is associated with improved quality of life, reduced risk of hospitalization and decreased rates of long-term mortality. One study of heart failure patients found that aerobic exercise (walking or cycling) at 60\u201370% of heart rate reserve 3\u20135 times per week for over 3 years led to improved health and overall quality of life (determined by a self-reported Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, a 23-question disease-specific questionnaire)", "[edit]Exercise triggers an increase in body temperature, and the post-exercise drop in temperature may promote falling asleep. Exercise may also reduce insomnia by decreasing arousal, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Insomnia is commonly linked with elevated arousal, anxiety, and depression, and exercise has effects on reducing these symptoms in the general population. These issues count among the most common among most of the population. Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the U.S., affecting 40 million adults in the United States age 18 and older, or 18.1% of the population every year. A 2010 review suggested that exercise generally improved sleep for most people, and may help with insomnia, but there is insufficient evidence to draw detailed conclusions about the relationship between exercise and sleep. A 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis suggested that physical activity has little association with sleep in healthy children", "[edit]The ability to perform daily activities and maintain independence requires strong muscles, balance, and endurance. Regular physical activity or exercise helps to improve and prevent the decline of muscalking, getting up out of a chair or leaning over to pick something up. Balance problems can reduce independence by interfering with activities of daily living. Regular physical activity can improve balance and reduce the risk of falling. Exercising regularly has many benefits for both your physical and mental health.\nCancer", ". The patients who underwent the exercise rehabilitation program had increased ejection fraction (60.81 vs. 53% control group), increased exercise tolerance, and reduced cardiovascular risk factors 6 months after starting the exercise rehabilitation program. This improvement in cardiovascular health in patients with atherosclerosis or post-MI is likely the result of increased myocardial perfusion in response to exercise, however, more research is required to fully understand these mechanisms.", "Obesity is a complex disease that affects whole-body metabolism and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Physical exercise results in numerous health benefits and is an important tool to combat obesity and its co-morbidities, including cardiovascular diseases. Exercise prevents both the onset and development of cardiovascular disease and is an important therapeutic tool to improve outcomes for patients with cardiovascular disease. Some benefits of exercise include enhanced mitochondrial function, restoration and improvement of vasculature, and the release of myokines from skeletal muscle that preserve or augment cardiovascular function.

Benefits include improved thinking or cognition for children ages 6-13, short-term reduction of anxiety for adults, and enhanced functional capacity in older adults. Regular physical activity can keep thinking, learning, and judgment skills sharp with age. It can also reduce the risk of depression and anxiety and improve sleep.\nWeight management\n[edit]Both dieting and physical activity play a critical role in maintaining healthy body weight, or maintaining successful weight loss. Physical activity helps control weight by using excess calories that would otherwise be stored as fat. Most activities burn calories, including sleeping, breathing, and digesting food. Balancing the calories consumed with the calories burned through physical activity will maintain one's weight.\nLong-term benefits", "[edit]Routine physical activity is important for building strong bones and muscles in children, but it is equally important for older adults. Bones and muscles work together to support daily movements. Physical activity strengthens muscles. Bones adapt by building more cells, and as a result, both become stronger. Strong bones and muscles protect against injury and improve balance and coordination. In addition, active adults experience less joint stiffness and improved flexibility. This becomes especially important with age, as it helps to prevent falls and the broken bones that may result. For those with arthritis, an exercise that keeps the muscles around the joint strong can act like a brace that will react to movement without the use of an actual brace.\nDaily activity", ". However, there have been several research findings indicating that certain forms of physical activity can improve the quality and duration of sleep. In fact, a 2019 study at The Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo concluded that moderate physical activity resulted in an increase in sleep efficiency and duration in adults diagnosed with insomnia. The duration refers to the hours of sleep a person gets on a nightly basis, while the quality indicates how well or sufficient it was. Having poor sleep quality can lead to negative short-term consequences like emotional distress and performance deficits. The psychosocial issues associated with these consequences can vary between adults, adolescents, and children. Some of the long-term effects of poor sleep quality can lead to conditions like hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and even weight-related issues.", "[edit]Regular physical activity and exercise decrease the risk of ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage. There is a dose-response relationship between increased physical activity and the risk of stroke. Being physically active before a stroke is associated with decreased admission stroke severity and improved post-stroke outcomes. Research indicates that individuals who engage in regular physical activity before experiencing a stroke demonstrate fewer stroke symptoms, smaller infarct volumes in ischemic strokes, smaller hematoma volumes in intracerebral hemorrhages, and higher post-stroke survival rates. Being physically active after a stroke is associated with improved recovery and function.\nSleep condition", ". Although a detailed analysis of the vast impact of diet on cardiometabolic health is outside the scope of this review, the importance of diet and exercise in tandem should not be ignored, as many studies have shown that cardiometabolic health is improved to a higher extent in response to a combined diet and exercise programs compared to either intervention alone.", "- ^ Viktorisson A, Reinholdsson M, Danielsson A, Palstam A, Sunnerhagen KS (January 2022). \"Pre-stroke physical activity in relation to post-stroke outcomes - linked to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF): A scoping review\".

There are several risk factors leading to the development and progression of CVD, but one of the most prominent is a sedentary lifestyle.

The robot, named Ropid, is capable of getting up, walking, running, and jumping.\nMany other robots have also been able to walk over the years like a bipedal walking robot.\nMathematical models\n[edit]Multiple mathematical models have been proposed to reproduce the kinematics observed in walking. These may be broadly broken down into four categories: rule-based models based on mechanical considerations and past literature, weakly coupled phase oscillators models, control-based models which guide simulations to maximize some property of locomotion, and phenomenological models which fit equations directly to the kinematics.\nRule-based models", "Walking differs from a running gait in a number of ways. The most obvious is that during walking one leg always stays on the ground while the other is swinging. In running there is typically a ballistic phase where the runner is airborne with both feet in the air (for bipedals).\nAnother difference concerns the movement of the centre of mass of the body. In walking the body \"vaults\" over the leg on the ground, raising the centre of mass to its highest point as the leg passes the vertical, and dropping it to the lowest as the legs are spread apart. Essentially kinetic energy of forward motion is constantly being traded for a rise in potential energy. This is reversed in running where the centre of mass is at its lowest as the leg is vertical. This is because the impact of landing from the ballistic phase is absorbed by bending the leg and consequently storing energy in muscles and tendons. In running there is a conversion between kinetic, potential, and elastic energy.", "[edit]The word walk is descended from the Old English wealcan 'to roll'. In humans and other bipeds, walking is generally distinguished from running in that only one foot at a time leaves contact with the ground and there is a period of double-support. In contrast, running begins when both feet are off the ground with each step. This distinction has the status of a formal requirement in competitive walking events. For quadrupedal species, there are numerous gaits which may be termed walking or running, and distinctions based upon the presence or absence of a suspended phase or the number of feet in contact any time do not yield mechanically correct classification. The most effective method to distinguish walking from running is to measure the height of a person's centre of mass using motion capture or a force plate at mid-stance. During walking, the centre of mass reaches a maximum height at mid-stance, while running, it is then at a minimum", "A 2023 study by the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, the largest study to date, found that walking at least 2,337 steps a day reduced the risk of dying from cardiovascular diseases, and that 3,967 steps a day reduced the risk of dying from any cause.

Interest in the sport, and the wagering which accompanied it, spread to the United States, Canada, and Australia in the 19th century. By the end of the 19th century, Pedestrianism was largely displaced by the rise in modern spectator sports and by controversy involving rules, which limited its appeal as a source of wagering and led to its inclusion in the amateur athletics movement", "There is an absolute limit on an individual's speed of walking (without special techniques such as those employed in speed walking) due to the upwards acceleration of the centre of mass during a stride \u2013 if it is greater than the acceleration due to gravity the person will become airborne as they vault over the leg on the ground.

Snowshoes work by distributing the weight of the person over a larger area so that the person's foot does not sink completely into the snow, a quality called \"flotation\". It is often said by snowshoers that if you can walk, you can snowshoe. This is true in optimal conditions, but snowshoeing properly requires some slight adjustments to walking. The method of walking is to lift the shoes slightly and slide the inner edges over each other, thus avoiding the unnatural and fatiguing \"straddle-gait\" that would otherwise be necessary. A snowshoer must be willing to roll his or her feet slightly as well. An exaggerated stride works best when starting out, particularly with larger or traditional shoes.", "[edit]The rule-based models integrate the past literature on motor control to generate a few simple rules which are presumed to be responsible for walking (e.g. \u201cloading of the left leg triggers unloading of right leg\u201d). Such models are generally most strictly based on the past literature and when they are based on a few rules can be easy to interpret. However, the influence of each rule can be hard to interpret when these models become more complex. Furthermore, the tuning of parameters is often done in an ad hoc way, revealing little intuition about why the system may be organized in this way. Finally, such models are typically based fully on sensory feedback, ignoring the effect of descending and rhythm generating neurons, which have been shown to be crucial in coordinating proper walking.\nCoupled oscillator models", "- Racewalking is a long-distance athletic event. Although it is a foot race, it is different from running in that one foot must appear to be in contact with the ground at all times.

This unique form of exercise has gained popularity for its various health and fitness benefits. It requires more attention and engages different muscles than forward walking, making it a valuable addition to a fitness routine. Some potential benefits of retro walking include improved balance, enhanced coordination, strengthened leg muscles, and reduced knee stress. It is also a rehabilitation exercise for certain injuries and can be way to switch up one's workout routine.\nBiomechanics", "[edit]Human walking is accomplished with a strategy called the double pendulum. During forward motion, the leg that leaves the ground swings forward from the hip. This sweep is the first pendulum. Then the leg strikes the ground with the heel and rolls through to the toe in a motion described as an inverted pendulum. The motion of the two legs is coordinated so that one foot or the other is always in contact with the ground. While walking, the muscles of the calf contract, raising the body's center of mass, while this muscle is contracted, potential energy is stored. Then gravity pulls the body forward and down onto the other leg and the potential energy is then transformed into kinetic energy. The process of human walking can save approximately sixty-five percent of the energy used by utilizing gravity in forward motion.", "Numerous walking festivals and other walking events take place each year in many countries. The world's largest multi-day walking event is the International Four Days Marches Nijmegen in the Netherlands. The \"Vierdaagse\" (Dutch for \"Four day Event\") is an annual walk that has taken place since 1909; it has been based at Nijmegen since 1916. Depending on age group and category, walkers have to walk 30, 40 or 50 kilometers each day for four days.[citation needed] Originally a military event with a few civilians, it now is a mainly civilian event. Numbers have risen in recent years, with over 40,000 now taking part, including about 5,000 military personnel.[citation needed] Due to crowds on the route, since 2004 the organizers have limited the number of participants. In the U.S", ". Further, compared to other apes, humans have longer legs and short dorsally oriented ischia (hipbone), which result in longer hamstring extensor moments, improving walking energy economy. Longer legs also support lengthened Achilles tendons which are thought to increase energy efficiency in bipedal locomotor activities. It was thought that hominins like Ardipithecus ramidus, which had a variety of both terrestrial and arboreal adaptions would not be as efficient walkers, however, with a small body mass A. ramidus had developed an energy efficient means of bipedal walking while still maintaining arboreal adaptations. Humans have long femoral necks, meaning that while walking, hip muscles do not require as much energy to flex while moving. These slight kinematic and anatomic differences demonstrate how bipedal walking may have developed as the dominant means of locomotion among early hominins because of the energy saved.", "In a metachronal wave gait, only one leg leaves contact with the ground at a time. This gait starts at one of the hind legs, then propagates forward to the mid and front legs on the same side before starting at the hind leg of the contralateral side. The wave gait is often used at slow walking speeds and is the most stable, since five legs are always in contact with the ground at a time.\nIn a tetrapod gait, two legs swing at a time while the other four legs remain in contact with the ground. There are multiple configurations for tetrapod gaits, but the legs that swing together must be on contralateral sides of the body. Tetrapod gaits are typically used at medium speeds and are also very stable.", "Walking\nWalking (also known as ambulation) is one of the main gaits of terrestrial locomotion among legged animals. Walking is typically slower than running and other gaits. Walking is defined as an \"inverted pendulum\" gait in which the body vaults over the stiff limb or limbs with each step. This applies regardless of the usable number of limbs\u2014even arthropods, with six, eight, or more limbs, walk. In humans, walking has health benefits including improved mental health and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and death.\nDifference from running", "[edit]It is theorized that \"walking\" among tetrapods originated underwater with air-breathing fish that could \"walk\" underwater, giving rise (potentially with vertebrates like Tiktaalik) to the plethora of land-dwelling life that walk on four or two limbs. While terrestrial tetrapods are theorised to have a single origin, arthropods and their relatives are thought to have independently evolved walking several times, specifically in hexapods, myriapods, chelicerates, tardigrades, onychophorans, and crustaceans. Little skates, members of the demersal fish community, can propel themselves by pushing off the ocean floor with their pelvic fins, using neural mechanisms which evolved as early as 420 million years ago, before vertebrates set foot on land.\nHominin", "[edit]In terms of tourism, the possibilities range from guided walking tours in cities, to organized trekking holidays in the Himalayas. In the UK the term walking tour also refers to a multi-day walk or hike undertaken by a group or individual. Well-organized systems of trails exist in many other European counties, as well as Canada, United States, New Zealand, and Nepal. Systems of lengthy waymarked walking trails now stretch across Europe from Norway to Turkey, Portugal to Cyprus. Many also walk the traditional pilgrim routes, of which the most famous is El Camino de Santiago, The Way of St. James.", "- Nordic walking is a physical activity and a sport, which is performed with specially designed walking poles similar to ski poles. Compared to regular walking, Nordic walking (also called pole walking) involves applying force to the poles with each stride. Nordic walkers use more of their entire body (with greater intensity) and receive fitness building stimulation not present in normal walking for the chest, lats, triceps, biceps, shoulder, abdominals, spinal and other core muscles that may result in significant increases in heart rate at a given pace. Nordic walking has been estimated as producing up to a 46% increase in energy consumption, compared to walking without poles.", "[edit]Elephants can move both forwards and backwards, but cannot trot, jump, or gallop. They use only two gaits when moving on land, the walk and a faster gait similar to running. In walking, the legs act as pendulums, with the hips and shoulders rising and falling while the foot is planted on the ground. With no \"aerial phase\", the fast gait does not meet all the criteria of running, although the elephant uses its legs much like other running animals, with the hips and shoulders falling and then rising while the feet are on the ground. Fast-moving elephants appear to 'run' with their front legs, but 'walk' with their hind legs and can reach a top speed of 18 km/h (11 mph). At this speed, most other quadrupeds are well into a gallop, even accounting for leg length.\nWalking fish", ". Pedestrianism was first codified in the last half of the 19th century, evolving into what would become racewalking, By the mid 19th century, competitors were often expected to extend their legs straight at least once in their stride, and obey what was called the \"fair heel and toe\" rule. This rule, the source of modern racewalking, was a vague commandment that the toe of one foot could not leave the ground before the heel of the next foot touched down. This said, rules were customary and changed with the competition. Racers were usually allowed to jog in order to fend off cramps, and it was distance, not code, which determined gait for longer races. Newspaper reports suggest that \"trotting\" was common in events.", "- Cross-country skiing \u2013 originally conceived like snow shoes as a means of travel in deep snow. Trails hiked in the summer are often skied in the winter and the Norwegian Trekking Association maintains over 400 huts stretching across thousands of kilometres of trails which hikers can use in the summer and skiers in the winter.\n- Beach walking is a sport that is based on a walk on the sand of the beach. Beach walking can be developed on compact sand or non-compact sand. There are beach walking competitions on non-compact sand, and there are world records of beach walking on non-compact sand in Multiday distances. Beach walking has a specific technique of walk.", "[edit]Data in the fossil record indicate that among hominin ancestors, bipedal walking was one of the first defining characteristics to emerge, predating other defining characteristics of Hominidae. Judging from footprints discovered on a former shore in Kenya, it is thought possible that ancestors of modern humans were walking in ways very similar to the present activity as long as 3 million years ago.", "Rambling\n[edit]In Britain, The Ramblers, a registered charity, is the largest organisation that looks after the interests of walkers, with some 100,000 members. Its \"Get Walking Keep Walking\" project provides free route guides, led walks, as well as information for people new to walking. The Long Distance Walkers Association in the UK is for the more energetic walker, and organizes lengthy challenge hikes of 20 or even 50 miles (30 to 80 km) or more in a day.

Some people prefer to walk indoors on a treadmill, or in a gym, and fitness walkers and others may use a pedometer to count their steps. Hiking is the usual word used in Canada, the United States and South Africa for long vigorous walks; similar walks are called tramps in New Zealand, or hill walking or just walking in Australia, the UK and the Irish Republic. In the UK, rambling is also used. Australians also bushwalk. In English-speaking parts of North America, the term walking is used for short walks, especially in towns and cities.

Often, these oscillators are thought to represent the central pattern generators underlying walking. These models have rich theory behind them, allow for some extensions based on sensory feedback, and can be fit to kinematics.

It is believed to have been selectively advantageous in hominin ancestors in the Miocene due to metabolic energy efficiency. Human walking has been found to be slightly more energy efficient than travel for a quadrupedal mammal of a similar size, like chimpanzees. The energy efficiency of human locomotion can be accounted for by the reduced use of muscle in walking, due to an upright posture which places ground reaction forces at the hip and knee. When walking bipedally, chimpanzees take a crouched stance with bent knees and hips, forcing the quadriceps muscles to perform extra work, which costs more energy. Comparing chimpanzee quadrupedal travel to that of true quadrupedal animals has indicated that chimpanzees expend one-hundred and fifty percent of the energy required for travel compared to true quadrupeds.", "., there is the annual Labor Day walk on Mackinac Bridge, Michigan, which draws over 60,000 participants; it is the largest single-day walking event;[citation needed] while the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Walk in Maryland draws over 50,000 participants each year.[citation needed] There are also various walks organised as charity events, with walkers sponsored for a specific cause.

When walking, a horse's legs follow this sequence: left hind leg, left front leg, right hind leg, right front leg, in a regular 1-2-3-4 beat. At the walk, the horse will always have one foot raised and the other three feet on the ground, save for a brief moment when weight is being transferred from one foot to another. A horse moves its head and neck in a slight up and down motion that helps maintain balance.\nIdeally, the advancing rear hoof oversteps the spot where the previously advancing front hoof touched the ground. The more the rear hoof oversteps, the smoother and more comfortable the walk becomes. Individual horses and different breeds vary in the smoothness of their walk. However, a rider will almost always feel some degree of gentle side-to-side motion in the horse's hips as each hind leg reaches forward.[citation needed]", "- Walkability\n- Walkathon\n- Walking audit\n- Walking bus\n- Walking city\n- Walking tour\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Cavagna GA, Heglund NC, Taylor CR (1977). \"Mechanical work in terrestrial locomotion: two basic mechanisms for minimizing energy expenditure\".

The term may also be used for some other cases of nonstandard fish locomotion, e.g., when describing fish \"walking\" along the sea floor, as the handfish or frogfish.\nInsects\n[edit]Insects must carefully coordinate their six legs during walking to produce gaits that allow for efficient navigation of their environment. Interleg coordination patterns have been studied in a variety of insects, including locusts (Schistocerca gregaria), cockroaches (Periplaneta americana), stick insects (Carausius morosus), and fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster). Different walking gaits have been observed to exist on a speed dependent continuum of phase relationships. Even though their walking gaits are not discrete, they can often be broadly categorized as either a metachronal wave gait, tetrapod gait, or tripod gait.", "In 2007, a study further explored the origin of human bipedalism, using chimpanzee and human energetic costs of locomotion. They found that the energy spent in moving the human body is less than what would be expected for an animal of similar size and approximately seventy-five percent less costly than that of chimpanzees. Chimpanzee quadrupedal and bipedal energy costs are found to be relatively equal, with chimpanzee bipedalism costing roughly ten percent more than quadrupedal. The same 2007 study found that among chimpanzee individuals, the energy costs for bipedal and quadrupedal walking varied significantly, and those that flexed their knees and hips to a greater degree and took a more upright posture, closer to that of humans, were able to save more energy than chimpanzees that did not take this stance", "The first purpose-built pedestrian street in Europe is the Lijnbaan in Rotterdam, opened in 1953. The first pedestrianised shopping centre in the United Kingdom was in Stevenage in 1959. A large number of European towns and cities have made part of their centres car-free since the early 1960s. These are often accompanied by car parks on the edge of the pedestrianised zone, and, in the larger cases, park and ride schemes. Central Copenhagen is one of the largest and oldest: It was converted from car traffic into pedestrian zone in 1962.\nIn robotics\n[edit]Generally, the first successful walking robots had six legs. As microprocessor technology advanced, the number of legs could be reduced and there are now robots that can walk on two legs. One, for example, is ASIMO. Although there has been significant advances, robots still do not walk nearly as well as human beings as they often need to keep their knees bent permanently in order to improve stability.", "The fastest \"walks\" with a four-beat footfall pattern are actually the lateral forms of ambling gaits such as the running walk, singlefoot, and similar rapid but smooth intermediate speed gaits. If a horse begins to speed up and lose a regular four-beat cadence to its gait, the horse is no longer walking but is beginning to either trot or pace.[citation needed]\nElephants", "A walking gait is considered tripod if three of the legs enter the swing phase simultaneously, while the other three legs make contact with the ground. The middle leg of one side swings with the hind and front legs on the contralateral side. Tripod gaits are most commonly used at high speeds, though it can be used at lower speeds. The tripod gait is less stable than wave-like and tetrapod gaits, but it is theorized to be the most robust. This means that it is easier for an insect to recover from an offset in step timing when walking in a tripod gait. The ability to respond robustly is important for insects when traversing uneven terrain.\nSee also\n[edit]- Arm swing in human locomotion\n- Duckwalk\n- Footpath\n- Gait training\n- Hand walking\n- Hot Girl Walk\n- International charter for walking\n- Kinhin\n- List of longest walks\n- New Urbanism\n- Obesity and walking\n- Pedestrian village\n- Pedestrian zone\n- Preferred walking speed\n- Student transport\n- Tobler's hiking function", "[edit]There has been a recent focus among urban planners in some communities to create pedestrian-friendly areas and roads, allowing commuting, shopping and recreation to be done on foot. The concept of walkability has arisen as a measure of the degree to which an area is friendly to walking. Some communities are at least partially car-free, making them particularly supportive of walking and other modes of transportation.

If you often walk in your neighborhood, consider walking somewhere new, such as a city or state park. Try taking routes with hills or stairs as you become used to walking more. Or walk faster for a few minutes and then slow down for a few minutes and repeat the cycle. If you're walking alone, tell someone which route you're taking. Walk in safe, well-lit locations.\n- Take missed days in stride. If you find yourself skipping your daily walks, don't give up. Remind yourself how good you feel when you include physical activity in your daily routine, and then get back on track.\nOnce you take that first step, you're on the way to an important destination \u2014 better health.\nMarch 12, 2024\n- Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. 2nd ed.

Turns out that fewer steps may have benefits.\nA 2021 study published in JAMA Network Open found that for people ages 38 to 50, 7,000 steps was associated with a lower mortality rate. If 7,000 still seems steep for you right now, a 2019 study published in JAMA Internal Medicine found that in older women, just 4,400 steps a day lowered mortality rates, compared with less active women, who took 2,700 steps.\nSo if 10,000 steps is not feasible for you to reach today, remember that small gains still make a difference. \u201cThe reality is that every step counts and every mile matters,\u201d says Shulman.\nIs it better to walk faster or longer?", "The best part? You don\u2019t have to tire yourself out on a treadmill at the gym to see these benefits. \u201cOne of my clients reduced her body fat by 2% in just one month by walking home from work each day, which was just under a mile,\u201d she says.\nIntervals are key here, says Michele Stanten, a walking coach and author of Prevention\u2019s Walk Your Way to Better Health. Increasing your speed for small bouts of time during, say, a 30-minute walk allows you to burn more calories than if you strolled at a moderate pace for half an hour. This approach also benefits your cardiorespiratory system. To try adding intervals, warm up for three minutes. Then spend 25 minutes alternating between one minute of walking almost as fast as you can go and one minute of brisk walking (aiming for a six on an intensity scale of one to 10). Cool down for two minutes.\n3. Improve heart health", "Research shows that moderate-intensity exercise\u2014and walking in particular\u2014ramps up our immune system. It increases the number of immune cells that attack pathogens in our body, which may lower your risk of becoming seriously ill from infectious diseases. Not only that, if you do get sick, research has found that people who walk more spend less time in the hospital. One study even found those who walked regularly could reduce their risk of dying from pneumonia compared to those who don\u2019t exercise regularly.\n12. Protect your bones", "While you may think that as long as you go the distance, you\u2019re still reaping the same benefits, several studies have shown over the years that walking faster is better for you and your long-term health. One 2006 study published in The British Journal of Sports Medicine found that the faster a person walks on average, the lower their risk of both all-cause mortality and death linked to heart disease.\nMore recently, a 2021 study published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention looked at more than 200,000 cancer survivors between the ages of 50 and 71 and found that those who walked at the slowest pace had more than double the risk of death from any cause, compared with those reporting the fastest walking pace.\nHow fast is fast enough? Per a 2019 study published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings, the optimal speed you should aim for is walking at least 4 miles per hour (mph). When it comes to the benefits of walking, slow and steady does not win the race.", "Working out regularly can help you sleep better at night. That\u2019s because physical activity naturally boosts the effects of melatonin, the sleep hormone. A 2019 study from Sleep found that postmenopausal women who do light to moderate-intensity physical activity snooze better at night than those who are sedentary. Another recent study found healthy adults who walked daily had a significant positive impact on sleep quality and length of sleep. Walking also helps reduce pain and stress, which can cause sleep disturbances.\n7. Boost your brainpower", "Walking is simple enough that all fitness levels can get those daily steps in. \u201cIt has tremendous benefits, from supporting a healthy immune system to boosting your metabolism to strengthening your joints, muscles, and bones\u2014not to mention it\u2019s amazing for stress relief and enjoying a little \u2018me time,\u2019\u201d says Austin.\nMeet the experts: Denise Austin, is a fitness expert and author of Denise Austin\u2019s Daily Dozen; Melina B.

Improve your mood", "If you currently count on your daily dose of coffee for keeping your digestive system going strong, get ready to start thanking your morning walk instead. That\u2019s because a regular walking routine can greatly improve your bowel movements, says Tara Alaichamy, D.P.T., the manager of rehabilitation services at Cancer Treatment Centers of America. \u201cOne of the very first things an abdominal surgery patient is required to do is to walk because it utilizes core and abdominal muscles, encouraging movement in our GI system,\u201d she says. In other words, when you start moving, your bowels start moving, too.\n11. Kickstart your immune system.", "How to create a walking routine\nIt\u2019s one thing to know that walking can support your healthy living goals, but actually creating a routine is something else entirely. \u201cLike almost everything in fitness, you have to build a base,\u201d says Albert Matheny, R.D., C.S.C.S., is a co-founder of SoHo Strength Lab. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t done anything in the past and then you try to do box jumps or run a marathon, the chance of having an injury is pretty high.\u201d\nWhile you\u2019re likely walking around throughout your day, actually creating a fitness routine around it is different. \u201cIt\u2019s the same as if you were creating a running routine,\u201d Matheny says. \u201cYou want to start small and build up your mileage over time.\u201d\nWhat your base should look like depends on your fitness level to start. If you haven\u2019t been exercising at all, setting a goal of walking a mile a day can be helpful to start, Matheny says. You can build up the mileage and have a goal of increasing your tempo from there.", "One of the most powerful ways to maintain a healthy weight, keep your joints strong, and live longer is also one of the simplest, no matter your age. The health benefits of walking are endless, and experts agree by adding walking to your daily routine, you can greatly improve your physical and mental health.\n\u201cWalking has always been my main source of cardio,\u201d says fitness expert Denise Austin.\nThe key is to strut for, ideally, at least 30 minutes a day, says Melina B. Jampolis, M.D., author of The Doctor on Demand Diet. And whether you decide to lace up your walking shoes and walk to work, pair up with a friend, or join a hiking club, research shows that walking can do everything from lower your blood pressure and reduce your risk of chronic diseases to making your brain sharper and your heart happier.", "If you\u2019re interested, Matheny says you can also add in light hand weights or a weighted vest.\nWhile your gear is simple, Matheny says it\u2019s important to stay on top of your shoes. \u201cThere\u2019s so much of a range in when to replace shoes and people,\u201d Matheny says. The big rule of thumb, however, is to swap out your shoes for a new pair after you\u2019ve logged 300 to 500 miles.\n\u201cIf you start to notice that your feet hurt, look at your shoes,\u201d Matheny says. He suggests checking out the sole\u2014if it looks worn, it\u2019s time for a replacement.", "If you\u2019ll be walking on a treadmill, Matheny recommends experimenting with the incline and speed to keep pushing yourself. Just make sure that you don\u2019t end up going so fast that you\u2019re hunched over the controls or holding onto the railing\u2014that\u2019s not doing your posture or fitness levels any favors.\nYou also may consider adding light hand weights to the mix for shorter periods of time. Like, do a minute on the treadmill with no weights, followed by a minute with weights, and keep switching off during your workout. \u201cI would certainly keep more focused on the walking itself,\u201d Matheny says.\nWhat gear do I need?\nThe great part about having a walking routine is that it\u2019s easily accessible to most people. In general, all you need is a good pair of walking shoes. These should be supportive, with a strong sole that can help propel you over all those miles. (Check out our best shoes for walking on concrete to get you started.)", "Plus, walking can help you believe in yourself and your health goals. Recent research found that of nearly 5,000 adults interviewed, those who walked regularly had higher health perceptions and were more likely to have better mental health.\n15. Live longer\nThat\u2019s right, walking can seriously help you add years to your life, and it doesn\u2019t take much to see results. In fact, one study found that people who did just 10 to 59 minutes of moderate exercise (like brisk walking) per week had an 18% lower risk of death during the study period compared to those who were inactive. Meanwhile, people who completed the recommended 150 minutes of weekly exercise in at least 10-minute spurts had a 31% lower risk of death. Other research shows the faster you walk, the more your risk drops. The longer life benefit is believed to come from the cardiorespiratory workout that walking provides.\nHow many steps should you walk every day?", "\u201cAs you continue to walk, you may notice your pants begin to fit more loosely around your midsection, even if the number on the scale isn\u2019t moving much,\u201d says Dr. Jampolis. That\u2019s because regular walking can help reduce fat and, as a result, improve your body\u2019s response to insulin, according to research.\nItching to up your calorie burn? When walking outside, plan a route that includes hills, alternate between speed walking and a slower pace, and challenge yourself to walk the same routes on different days to see if you can beat your previous times, says Austin. If you really want to set high goals, she recommends aiming to hit 10,000 steps a day.\n\u201cDaily walking increases metabolism by burning extra calories and by preventing muscle loss, which is particularly important as we get older,\u201d says Ariel Iasevoli, a personal trainer in New York City.", "14. Make other goals seem more attainable.\nWhen you become a regular walker, you will have established a regular routine\u2014and when you have a routine, you are more likely to continue with the activity and take on new healthy behaviors. \u201cOur bodies are not meant to be sedentary all day. Any type of movement is better than no movement, and being able to find a type of movement best suited for your age and fitness level is super important so you feel empowered and motivated to stick with it,\u201d says Marisa Golan, a certified personal trainer, Base Ops Fitness Coach at Fort Athletic Club, and owner of e(M)powered personal training.\n\u201cWalking for older individuals is a great gateway exercise to get your muscles moving and your heart elevated. You can also speed it up to more of a speed walk to increase your heart rate.\u201d", "If you\u2019re feeling frazzled or overwhelmed, walking can help lower your stress. Walking reduces the stress hormone cortisol, which helps you feel less stressed and more relaxed, says Joyce Shulman, co-founder and CEO of 99 Walks & Jetti Fitness and author of Walk Your Way to Better.\nA 2018 study published in Health Promotion Perspectives showed that just 10 minutes of walking lowers anxiety and depression and increases focus and creativity. Plus, research shows that taking your stroll outside can make a huge difference, too. A 2022 study published in Molecular Psychiatry found that a 60-minute walk in nature decreases activity in brain regions involved in stress processing. In contrast, brain activity in those regions remained stable after a 60-minute walk in an urban environment. So, go touch some grass!\n6. Improve your sleep", "The research here is quickly growing. In one study, brain scans of people who walked briskly for one hour three times a week showed the decision-making areas of their brains worked more efficiently than people who attended education seminars instead. Other research shows physical exercise, like walking, can improve brain function in older women. Experts think these benefits could be due in part to increased blood flow to the brain that occurs with exercise. So when you get your feet moving, your brain starts working better too!\n8. Alleviate joint pain\nContrary to what you might think, pounding pavement can help improve your range of motion and mobility because walking increases blood flow to tense areas and helps strengthen the muscles surrounding your joints.", "A 2022 study published in Nature Medicine has shown that walking can reduce your risk for a variety of chronic diseases. One study showed that walking 8,200 steps effectively reduced the risk of chronic conditions, including: obesity, sleep apnea, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), major depressive disorder (MDD), type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. The same study also found that walking even more steps continues to increase walking\u2019s benefits for nearly every health condition studied.\nThe American Diabetes Association officially recommends walking to lower blood sugar levels and lower your overall risk for type 2 diabetes. One 2022 study published in Sports Medicine showed specifically that just two minutes of walking after eating can help lower blood sugar. Even the shortest of walks can make a difference.\nStill, for disease prevention, longer walks are key. Stanten recommends doing one hour-long walk at least once or twice a week.\n5. Reduce your stress", "Walking can also help keep your bones strong and healthy, reducing your risk for bone loss later in life. Per Mayo Clinic, walking works directly on the bones in your legs, hips and lower spine to slow density loss. Additionally, 2022 study published in PLOS ONE found that long-term brisk walking is an efficient way to improve bone density. Specifically, taking brisk walks for 30 minutes per day 3 or more times per week is recommended to prevent bone loss in premenopausal women.\n13. Enhance creativity\nWhether you\u2019re feeling stuck at work or you\u2019ve been searching for a solution to a tricky problem, research shows it\u2019s a good idea to get moving: According to a 2014 study in the Journal of Experimental Psychology, Learning, Memory, and Cognition, going for a walk can spark creativity. \u201cResearchers administered creative-thinking tests to subjects while seated and while walking and found that the walkers thought more creatively than the sitters,\u201d says Dr. Jampolis.", "*Additional story experts include: Joyce Shulman, is co-founder and CEO of 99 Walks & Jetti Fitness and author of Walk Your Way to Better; Luis Navarro, M.D., is founder and director of The Vein Treatment Center in New York City; Tara Alaichamy, D.P.T., is the manager of rehabilitation services at Cancer Treatment Centers of America; Marisa Golan, is a certified personal trainer, Base Ops Fitness Coach at Fort Athletic Club, and owner of e(M)powered personal training; Albert Matheny, R.D., C.S.C.S., is a co-founder of SoHo Strength Lab.\n..", "\u201cThe venous system includes a circulatory section known as \u2018the second heart,\u2019 which is formed by muscles, veins, and valves located in our calf and foot,\u201d he explains. \u201cThis system works to push blood back up to the heart and lungs\u2014and walking strengthens this secondary circulatory system by strengthening and preserving leg muscle, which boosts healthy blood flow.\u201d\nIf you already suffer from varicose veins, daily walking can help ease related swelling and restlessness in your legs, says Dr. Navarro. \u201cAlso, if you are genetically predisposed to have varicose and/or spider veins, walking daily can help delay the onset.\u201d\n10. Stimulate your digestive system", "In fact, research shows that walking for at least 10 minutes a day\u2014or about an hour every week\u2014can stave off disability and arthritis pain in older adults. A 2019 study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine followed 1,564 adults older than 49 with lower-body joint pain. Participants who walked for an hour each week were more likely to remain disability-free four years later. An additional report found that walking was a safe, inexpensive, and convenient physical activity for those with arthritis of all fitness levels.\n9. Delay the onset of varicose veins\nAs you age, your risk of varicose veins increases. However, walking is a proven way to prevent them from developing, says Luis Navarro, M.D., founder and director of The Vein Treatment Center in New York City.", "Going for a walk is an easy fitness strategy that can you feel better, says Dr. Jampolis. In fact, research shows that just 10 minutes of walking can lift your spirits. Plus, the effect may be amplified even more if you take a stroll through some greenery.\n\u201cResearch shows that regular walking actually modifies your nervous system so much that you\u2019ll experience a decrease in anger and hostility,\u201d Dr. Jampolis says, especially when you\u2019re going for a stroll through some greenery or soaking in a bit of sunlight. This can be particularly helpful during the colder months, when seasonal depression spikes.\nFinally, when you make your walks social\u2014you stride with, say, your partner, a neighbor, or a good friend\u2014that interaction helps you feel connected, Dr. Jampolis says, which can make you feel happier.\n2. Burn calories and maintain a healthy weight", "One of the major ways that walking can improve your heart health is by lowering your blood pressure. Some research shows that for every 1,000 daily steps you take, you could lower your systolic blood pressure by .45 points. That means if you clock in 10,000 daily steps, your systolic blood pressure is likely to be 2.25 points lower than someone else who walks only 5,000 daily steps.\nOne of the most cited studies on walking and health, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, found that those who walked enough to meet physical activity guidelines had a 30% lower risk of cardiovascular events (like a heart attack or stroke) compared with those who did not walk regularly. Another study found that especially for older adults, every 500 additional steps taken daily was associated with 14% lower risk of heart disease, stroke or heart failure.\n4. Reduce your risk of chronic diseases", "But if you want to add walking to your existing fitness routine, Matheny says you can start with higher mileage goals, like three miles a day, and build up mileage and speed from there.\nHow to challenge yourself in a walking workout\nWalking is a form of exercise that takes time, and the right walking routine for you has to work within your parameters, as well as where you plan to walk. Ideally, you\u2019d also be able to push yourself as you go forward to keep increasing your fitness levels.\nIf you\u2019ll be walking outside, Matheny recommends increasing your speed and distance logged as you start to feel more comfortable. Keep in mind that while walking a consistent distance over time allows you to get your heart rate up and keep it elevated, it\u2019s also more than OK to break up your walking goals into smaller chunks throughout the day, if that\u2019s all you have time for."], "title": "15 Health Benefits of Walking, According to Doctors and Trainers"}, "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_for_Americans": {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_for_Americans", "description": "The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans are based on a comprehensive review of scientific research about physical activity and health.

The second edition includes new evidence that shows physical activity also has many immediate health benefits such as reduced anxiety and blood pressure. The messages from the Physical Activity Guidelines are also found in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans which provide recommendations for healthy food choices and regular physical activity.", "Moderate activities are those such as ballroom and line dancing, biking on level ground or with a few hills, general gardening, walking briskly, and water aerobics. Vigorous activities take more effort than moderate activities. Vigorous activities are those such as aerobic dance, biking faster than 10 miles per hour, heavy gardening, race walking, jogging, or running, and swimming fast or swimming laps. Muscle-strengthening activities should include all of the major muscle groups, such as legs, hips, back, chest, stomach, shoulders, and arms.\nThe 2008 Guidelines indicated it was only beneficial to do at least 10 minutes of an activity at a time.

Inactive people should \u201cstart low and go slow\u201d by starting with lower intensity activities and gradually increasing how often and how long activities are done.\n- Protect themselves by using appropriate gear and sports equipment, choosing safe environments, following rules and policies, and making sensible choices about when, where, and how to be active.\n- Be under the care of a health care provider if they have chronic conditions or symptoms. People with chronic conditions and symptoms can consult a health care professional or physical activity specialist about the types and amounts of activity appropriate for them.\nOther federal guidance related to youth physical activity\n[edit]Fundamental movement skills", "- For substantial health benefits, adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) to 300 minutes (5 hours) a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes (1 hour and 15 minutes) to 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. Preferably, aerobic activity should be spread throughout the week.\n- Additional health benefits are gained by engaging in physical activity beyond the equivalent of 300 minutes (5 hours) of moderate-intensity physical activity a week.\n- Adults should also do muscle-strengthening activities of moderate or greater intensity and that involve all major muscle groups on 2 or more days a week, as these activities provide additional health benefits."], "title": "Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans - Wikipedia"}, "https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/mental-benefits-of-walking": {"url": "https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/mental-benefits-of-walking", "description": "There are numerous benefits of walking. Some of the most common include. Improved sleep. Better endurance. Stress relief. Improvement in mood. Increased energy and stamina. Reduced tiredness that ...", "snippets": ["One of the best ways to begin a new walking routine is to start small and take it easy on yourself as you gradually build up endurance. Before you take a long walk, stretch to warm up. Start at a pace that feels relaxed, then build up to a brisk walk. Toward the end of your walk, give yourself time to slow down again.\nEach time you go out, carve out a comfortable walking route, then extend your distance over the next few days or weeks. Give yourself goals to reach and celebrate your wins. Remember, it's not always about the length of your route. It's also about the quality of the walk and the benefits you get from doing it consistently.\nA good rule of thumb is to walk for about 30-45 minutes, either all at once or broken into 10-minute chunks. This ends up being about 2-4 miles. You can measure your distance by wearing a watch to measure the time or buckling a pedometer to your belt to measure the distance.\nHere are some helpful tips to get you started:", "Do it safely. If you're planning on walking at night, consider wearing brightly colored clothing and a reflector to help cars see you when they're passing by. Keep an eye on your surroundings, and always stay safe.\nSwitch up your routine. If you walk outdoors, you can plan a variety of different routes. If you're walking by yourself, tell someone which route you're taking for the day. Always walk in well-lit and safe locations.\nDon\u2019t worry about missed days. If you find yourself forgetting to go on your daily walks from time to time, don't give up. Get back on track by reminding yourself of how good you feel when you include physical activity in your daily routine.\nLimits of Walking as a Mood Booster\nWalking can offer wonderful mental benefits. The key is to do it consistently. Balance it with a healthy lifestyle and supportive environment. This could include eating a nutritious diet, getting enough sleep, and surrounding yourself with positive influences.", "Walking provides the best of both worlds. It offers the physical benefits of exercise while also boosting your emotional well-being. In fact, walking regularly can help ease symptoms related to chronic mental health conditions like anxiety and depression.\nYou can walk anywhere without equipment or a special membership. The more you do it, the more positive effects you\u2019ll experience.\nThe Benefits of Walking\nThere are numerous benefits of walking. Some of the most common include.\n- Improved sleep\n- Better endurance\n- Stress relief\n- Improvement in mood\n- Increased energy and stamina\n- Reduced tiredness that can increase mental alertness\n- Weight loss\n- Reduced cholesterol and improved cardiovascular (heart) health", "Set yourself up for success. Start with a simple goal such as taking a 5-minute walk during your lunch break. When this becomes a routine, set a new goal like walking for 20 minutes after work. Find enough time during the day for your walks. With this plan, you could be setting goals that seemed impossible at the start.\nMake walking enjoyable. If you don't like walking by yourself, you can ask a neighbor or a friend to join you. If your group energizes you, consider joining a walking group or a health club. You can try listening to music. This might make walking less boring.\nDon't forget about comfort. You'll want to have comfortable shoes that won't hurt your feet if you're walking for long distances. It's helpful to give some thought to what you want to wear as well. Layers can help in unpredictable weather conditions. Water-repellent synthetic fabric can help keep you cool and dry if you work up a sweat.", "Walking helps boost your mood because it increases blood flow and blood circulation to the brain and body. It has a positive influence on your hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is your central nervous response system. This is good because the HPA axis is responsible for your stress response. When you exercise by walking, you calm your nerves, which can make you feel less stressed.\nYou can build on the positive effects of walking by inviting friends to join you. Walking with others for one or two days per week can have enormous benefits. Physical exercise combined with positive social interactions can improve negative moods, ward off depression, and improve self-esteem. Try to walk 3 days a week for 10-30 minutes at a time.\nHow to Create a Walking Routine", "It\u2019s also important to consider that although walking can be a powerful tool, it's not a substitute for professional mental health treatment.

The American Academy of Neurology's clinical practice guideline for mild cognitive impairment indicates that clinicians should recommend regular exercise (two times per week) to individuals who have been diagnosed with this condition.", "[edit]Concordant with the functional roles of the brain structures that exhibit increased gray matter volumes, regular exercise over a period of several months has been shown to persistently improve numerous executive functions and several forms of memory. In particular, consistent aerobic exercise has been shown to improve attentional control,[note 3] information processing speed, cognitive flexibility (e.g., task switching), inhibitory control,[note 4] working memory updating and capacity,[note 5] declarative memory,[note 6] and spatial memory. In healthy young and middle-aged adults, the effect sizes of improvements in cognitive function are largest for indices of executive functions and small to moderate for aspects of memory and information processing speed. It may be that in older adults, individuals benefit cognitively by taking part in both aerobic and resistance type exercise of at least moderate intensity", "[edit]Reviews of neuroimaging studies indicate that consistent aerobic exercise increases gray matter volume in nearly all regions of the brain, with more pronounced increases occurring in brain regions associated with memory processing, cognitive control, motor function, and reward; the most prominent gains in gray matter volume are seen in the prefrontal cortex, caudate nucleus, and hippocampus, which support cognitive control and memory processing, among other cognitive functions. Moreover, the left and right halves of the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, and the cingulate cortex appear to become more functionally interconnected in response to consistent aerobic exercise. Three reviews indicate that marked improvements in prefrontal and hippocampal gray matter volume occur in healthy adults that regularly engage in medium intensity exercise for several months"], "title": "Neurobiological effects of physical exercise - Wikipedia"}, "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39045858/": {"url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39045858/", "description": "Conclusions: Various forms of walking can be effective in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety, and the effects of walking are comparable to active controls.

However, there is no study comparing several different kinds of physical exercises (eg, via a network meta-analysis), including walking, in terms of their effects on mental health outcomes. Based on the existing evidence, walking (especially at a pace that can reach a certain speed, result in a certain heart rate, or reach moderate intensity) can be recommended as an alternative to other exercises and evidence-based interventions to improve mental health outcomes. Future studies can explore the dose-response relationship between walking and reduced mental health symptoms to provide more detailed instructions to people in need.Based on the results found in this systematic review, incorporating walking into public health policies and initiatives can potentially decrease the prevalence of depression and enhance overall mental well-being", "]. It suggested that the effect of walking has no association with the location of walking (ie, indoors or outdoors). This might be important to homebound people (eg, older people or people who were home monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic). Walking may also be effective regardless of whether people wear a pedometer and how old they are. In this review, walking at a self-selected pace was not effective on the selected mental health symptoms, whereas at least moderate-intensity walking and walking at a guided pace were effective. However, this study did not conduct a subgroup analysis of mild-intensity walking due to the limited number of relevant studies. These findings may indicate that walking at a guided or set pace (eg, a pace that can reach a certain speed or result in a certain heart rate), especially when such walking can reach a moderate intensity, is recommended, which is consistent with the WHO guideline that recommends moderate-intensity physical activity [ ]", "].

Future studies can closely examine the effects of mild-intensity walking on mental health.In the remaining subgroup analyses, both adult participants who were depressed and those who were not depressed could benefit from walking, and participants who were depressed could benefit more. The meta-regression showed that baseline depression was the main factor that affected the effect of walking. The subgroup analysis of baseline anxiety was not conducted on anxiety symptoms due to a lack of data. Shorter intervention durations (<3 mo), walking without applying motivation, and walking without a pedometer were found to be significantly better than intervention durations of 3 to 6 months, walking while applying motivation, and walking with a pedometer, respectively. However, the latter three characteristics also had small and statistically significant positive effects on depressive or anxiety symptoms", "], and working memory training could reduce anxiety and depression vulnerability [ ]. Hence, the settlement of walking pace and the involvement of working memory may serve as the moderators in the effect of walking instructions. Further studies are needed to confirm this mechanism.The effect of walking was found to be comparable to that of active controls, which included other kinds of moderate-intensity physical exercise and other evidence-based interventions.

The video was viewed three million times and sparked the trending hashtag #hotgirlwalk (1.1B views) that appears on videos like those from @meeksbruh (18.2M views) and @nataliexelise (1.7M views).\nBut are the glories of walking overrated? Here we bust a few myths and back up the cold hard truth about walking as exercise.\n5 Reasons Walking Is Good for Your Health\n1. Myth: Walking 10,000 Steps a Day Is Ideal", "For the general public, walking is easier on the body than running, Fredericson says, and there is less chance of injury. Plus this low impact activity is something that everyone can do. Running is more of a skill, and some people have bodies that better accommodate this type of activity, he says. Hip and knee alignment, body weight, and the shape of your foot\u2019s arch can either predispose you for issues or lead to your success when running, he says.\nA lot of people ask should they run or walk, Wall adds, and it comes down to one simple thing: What is your goal? If you are looking to get fit and improve things like oxygen capacity and CO2 output, then running is a better tool, he says. If you are looking for things like blood pressure reduction, feeling better, or better sleep, walking is better for this.\nModerate to intense walking can reduce the risk of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes when expending the same amount of energy as running, research has found.", "The name might be new, but the act is not revolutionary by any means: Silent walking means taking a walk without distractions. No podcast through your earbuds, no chatting with a friend on the phone, or no walking playlist to listen to. Proponents of silent walking say that it allows you the chance to be alone with your thoughts and practice what could be thought of as a moving meditation.\nWhile there isn\u2019t research on \u201csilent walking,\u201d there is evidence in a systematic review to show that meditative and mindful walking is beneficial for generating positive emotions, decreasing distress, and reducing blood pressure.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that walking and not being silent isn\u2019t good for you. If the promise of a podcast, a catchy tune, or a conversation with a friend gets you on the treadmill or out the door, then consider that a win.\n9. Myth: Indoor and Outdoor Steps Yield the Same Results", "When you participate in physical activity, you encourage your muscle cells to soak up glucose from your bloodstream for energy, decreasing your blood sugar in the short term and helping maintain insulin sensitivity over the long-term, according to the American Diabetes Association. These things help lower your risk of developing type 2 diabetes and the complications that come with it. And while any type of exercise is good for regulating blood glucose, walking is especially effective \u2014 especially when you do it right after eating.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that walking for just two minutes after eating a meal effectively decreased blood sugar better than standing or simply sitting. This can help people with diabetes or prediabetes manage their blood glucose, as well as help others improve their metabolic health.", "She enjoys reading, all sports (particularly Olympic weightlifting), walking her dog, and spending time with her husband, sons, and their extended family.", "Other research found that getting out \u201cas soon as possible\u201d after a meal is best rather than waiting to walk. (That research also points out that since walking can minimize blood sugar spikes, it may also help lessen inflammation and protect your heart.)\n3. Myth: Walking Can Cure Depression and Anxiety\nMost exercise is associated with mental health benefits, but in most cases no single exercise, like walking, can by itself cure a clinical disorder.\nHow does walking affect mood? Most people operate in a sympathetic or more stressful state, says Michael Fredericson, MD, sports medicine physiatrist, doctor, and surgeon at Stanford Medicine in California, and exercising can bring a person into a parasympathetic or more relaxed state. \u201cOver time, consistent exercise releases proteins called neurotrophic or growth factors, which cause nerve cells to grow and make new connections. The improvement in brain function makes you feel better,\u201d he explains.", "Many people use 10,000 steps as a benchmark for a daily goal, but this number actually originated as part of a marketing campaign rather than coming from scientific evidence, explains Amy Bantham, DrPH, CEO and founder of Move to Live More, a health and fitness consulting company. Bantham has conducted research on physician exercise referrals and patient exercise behavior change.\nThere isn\u2019t yet conclusive scientific evidence showing that this number is the ideal target for better health than a lower daily step count, Bantham says.\nOne study did show that walking more steps each day was incrementally linked to more benefit when it came to reduction in cancer and heart disease incidence, as well as mortality up to 10,000 daily steps, at which point the benefit leveled off.", "To make your walks more of a challenge and to up the number of calories burned during your walk, intervals (alternating between higher and moderate or lower intensity periods of movement) can be very effective, Fredericson says. Incorporating intervals is great for fitness because your heart rate is more elevated than when you take a leisurely walk, ultimately burning more fat and calories. For another approach to intervals, you can also walk on an incline to increase the intensity, either on a treadmill or outside on the road or trail.\n7. Myth: You Have to Walk 30 Minutes Continuously to See Health Benefits\nBased on the HHS Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans\u2019 goal of 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity, Wall recommends people walk 30 minutes every day, five times a week to reach this baseline.", "When you\u2019re walking outdoors, you\u2019re traversing terrain that changes (such as a shift in elevation) and different surroundings (such as green space) compared with indoor treadmill walking. And those differences may matter: One study that compared the effects of indoor versus outdoor walking found that \u201cgreen\u201d exercise \u2014 that is, being outside in a natural environment \u2014 helped hoofers achieve a higher average heart rate compared with indoor walking, even though they didn\u2019t feel as if they were exerting themselves more.\nThe outdoor walk session also improved their feelings of energy. (Treadmill walking did not.) The authors concluded that walking outside might be more enjoyable and help people stick with exercise.\nBut if you aren\u2019t able to go outside \u2014 or want to \u2014 know that your indoor steps are certainly worthwhile.", "Anthony Wall, personal trainer and director of international business development for the American Council on Exercise (ACE), says what is clearer from the research is that more steps are generally linked to more benefit.\nA meta-analysis attempted to determine the minimal and optimal daily step count to improve one\u2019s health, analyzing over 111,000 people across 12 studies. Just about 2,600 and 2,800 steps per day moved the needle, decreasing death from any cause by 8 percent and reducing cardiovascular disease risk by 11 percent, respectively, compared with 2,000 steps per day. Benefits peaked at 8,800 steps per day.\nThe bottom line is that the jury is still out on an exact minimum number of daily steps that delivers the most benefit. And while step counts are good tangible goals that work for many people, there are other good fitness markers like time and frequency, Wall says.\n2. Fact: Walking Helps With Blood Sugar Control", "A common misconception, however, is that you must complete these 30 minutes consecutively, Fredericson said. You can break it up into smaller segments and walk 5 to 10 minutes at a time multiple times throughout the day and still get the same benefits of walking 30 minutes once in a day, he says, something that\u2019s also supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nDiscover the significant health benefits of walking and elevate your walking routine with the best walking shoes for women, designed to maximize comfort and performance. Learn more about how proper footwear can enhance your experience and contribute to your overall well-being.\n8. Fact: Silent Walking Is Good for You\nAnother TikTok trend that\u2019s gotten people excited to get out and walk more is #silentwalking (904.3K views).", "However, that doesn\u2019t mean that exercise is all you need for your mental health. If you have situational depression \u2014 that is, a reaction to a stressful, but short-term period in one\u2019s life \u2014 then measures like physical activity and finding support from family and friends may help move the needle for you, says Dr. Fredericson. However, if you have clinical depression, then seeking out professional help is a must, as therapy or medication may be needed, he adds. It can be dangerous to self-treat on your own, and walking will not be an adequate therapy for a mental health disorder.\n4. Myth: Running Is Always Superior to Walking\nWalking is a low impact exercise that offers benefits such as promoting endorphin release, increasing blood flow to the body and the brain, and improving bone health, without exerting the extra strain on your joints, Bantham says.", "Everyday Health follows strict sourcing guidelines to ensure the accuracy of its content, outlined in our editorial policy.

Myth: You Shouldn\u2019t Walk Every Day of the Week\nBecause walking is a low-intensity activity, it is perfectly reasonable for people to get out and walk each day, Wall said. \u201cIf you think about any population in a city in the United States, these walkable cities, people are walking every day,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the benefits is it\u2019s something that most people, assuming they don\u2019t have preexisting conditions, can do on a daily basis.\u201d\nHowever, if you are really exerting yourself on your walks, Fredericson says, then it might be good to take one rest day a week or incorporate other forms of exercise like cycling or swimming into your routine.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, adults should do 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity activity (such as brisk walking) a week, or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous intensity activity (such as running) a week for substantial health benefits.", "- Davis DW, Carrier B, Cruz K, et al.

Fact: You Must Walk Faster to Burn More Calories\nWhile any activity burns calories, the more intensity you bring to your workouts, the more calories you burn. That\u2019s true for walking, too. The number of calories burned in a given workout depends on the individual\u2019s weight and body composition, Bantham says.\nHarvard Health published comparisons of calories burned in 30 minutes based on the activity and weight range. A 155-pound person burns 133 calories per 30 minutes of walking at 3.5 miles per hour, and 175 calories per 30 minutes of walking at 4 miles per hour.\nThat means if someone\u2019s goal is fat loss, you\u2019re going to need to walk at a higher intensity or walk for much longer than other activities to see those desired results, he says.", "Walking Workouts: 9 Myths and Facts to Know\nShould you be walking every single day?

Great news for those of us that dread going on a jog.\nPast studies have supported this notion, finding that a daily walk can reduce the risk of stroke in both men and women, reduce the days spent in a hospital each year and can even lower your risk of death by up to 39 percent (when compared with no leisure-time physical activity).\nA study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that those who adhered to a walking program showed significant improvements in blood pressure, slowing of resting heart rate, reduction of body fat and body weight, reduced cholesterol, improved depression scores with better quality of life and increased measures of endurance.\nThe Mental Benefits of Walking", "\u201cWith that being said, walking is a really good form of exercise and can help you reach your fitness and weight-loss goals. As a lifelong track athlete, who has marveled at race walkers (check out the Olympic walkers on YouTube!), I don\u2019t scoff at walking,\u201d says Ford. \u201cIn fact, walking is the suggested workout over running for many people. For example, those with knee, ankle and back problems and also for people who are overweight to obese. Walking is a lower impact exercise and can be done for longer periods of time.\u201d\nAnd there is no shortage of scientific research to back up the effectiveness of adding walking to your fitness routine.\nThe Physical Benefits of Walking", "While the physical benefits are notable, the mental boost that can be gleaned from adding a walk to your daily routine may be more immediate.\nOne Stanford University study found that walking increased creative output by an average of 60 percent. Researchers labelled this type of creativity \u201cdivergent thinking,\u201d which they define as a thought process used to generate creative ideas by exploring many possible solutions. According to the study, \u201cwalking opens up the free flow of ideas, and it is a simple and robust solution to the goals of increasing creativity and increasing physical activity.\u201d\nPsychologists found that a 10-minute walk may be just as good as a 45-minute workout when it comes to relieving the symptoms of anxiety.\nWhich makes sense, since science shows that engaging in activities that allow our minds to wander promotes a mental state conducive to innovative ideas and \u201cah-ha!\u201d moments.", "\"By adding some variables into the mix you can turn a simple walk into a fun, fast interval session, burning a high level of calories, and in turn, crushing your fat cells,\u201d adds Rob McGillivray, Founder of RETROFIT in West Hollywood. \u201cEssentially we burn the most calories by repeatedly raising and lowering the heart rate, as opposed to keeping the heart rate at one steady pace, whether that be high or low. So, if you were to compare the heart rate fluctuations of someone walking up a mixture of steep hills and then add in variations of walking speeds, styles of walking (such as lunging, striding, side cross overs, etc.) to that of someone primarily running at a medium pace on a level gradient, you could see greater all round results on both your body's caloric burn and a greater degree of lower limb muscle groups being targeted. It is also said that hill walking, as opposed to running on a level gradient, can enable you to burn more fat without attacking lean muscle tissue.\u201d", "\u201cWhile I would love to say that walking can be just as effective of a workout as running, I\u2019m not going to lie to you. In fairness, the two really shouldn\u2019t be compared against each other,\u201d says John Ford, certified exercise physiologist, who runs JKF Fitness & Health in New York City. \u201cRunning, due to larger muscle recruitment, greater forces exerted and faster motion capability, will always have the proverbial leg up on walking.\"\nBut while walking may not be a better workout, it may be a better exercise choice for some people.", "But it\u2019s not only your creativity that will benefit from the mental lift. The act of walking is also a proven mood booster. One study found that just 12 minutes of walking resulted in an increase in joviality, vigor, attentiveness and self-confidence versus the same time spent sitting. Walking in nature, specifically, was found to reduce ruminating over negative experiences, which increases activity in the brain associated with negative emotions and raises risk of depression.\nWalking has also been shown to improve memory and prevent the deterioration of brain tissue as we age. Plus, psychologists studying how exercise relieves anxiety and depression also suggest that a 10-minute walk may be just as good as a 45-minute workout when it comes to relieving the symptoms of anxiety and boosting mood.\nStarting to think your neighbor who walks around the block every morning is on to something?\nHow to get the most out of your walking workout", "Try Intervals: \u201cA quick way to get the most out of your workout on the treadmill whether walking or running is to challenge your body with interval training,\" says Crockett. \u201cYou can build up your strength and cardio endurance by using short intervals to maximize your time.\u201d", "Utilize the Incline Feature: \u201cTreadmills have a variety of uses and one of them that many people don't take advantage of is the incline feature. Walking or running on a treadmill is meant to simulate how you walk or run outside. The incline feature turns what could be compared to walking or running on a sidewalk, into a motion more similar to walking up a mountain,\u201d says Crockett. \u201cAdjusting the incline on a treadmill has several benefits. Your workout intensifies because you're placing more demand on the body to keep up with the machine. The higher you set the incline, the more energy your body is forced to use to help activate your glutes, quadriceps and calves, all of which have to put in overtime when the incline is increased. This increase of energy burns more calories and depending on your weight and cardiovascular endurance can also burn more fat.\u201d", "Plus, it can be a better option for those with injuries or pain. \u201cAdding an incline is a great way to increase the challenge for your cardiovascular system and get the same kind of benefits that you can get from jogging or running without the same amount of wear and tear on your knees,\u201d says Tyler Spraul, a Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist and the Head Trainer at Exercise.com.\nCrockett does make one caveat: \u201cOne common mistake people make is setting the machine to a pace that requires you to hold on,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen adjusting the incline or speed, make sure it is set at a pace that you can safely walk or run on without hanging on for dear life. This takes away from the muscle engagement and energy required to actually walk or run at the level you set it to.\u201d", "\u201cWalking can be as good as a workout, if not better, than running,\u201d says Dr. Matt Tanneberg, CSCS, a sports Chiropractor and Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist in Phoenix, Arizona who works with elite athletes. \u201cYou hear of people 'plateauing' when they continue to do the same workout routine and stop seeing results. I see patients all the time that plateau from running, they will run the same distance, speed and time, day in and day out. You need to constantly be switching up your exercise routine in order to get the maximum benefit for your health.\u201d\nYes, running is more physically demanding, which leads people to label it a \u201cbetter\u201d workout.", "\u201cThere are many reasons to walk for exercise,\u201d says Ann Green, M.S., past heptathlon world athlete, yoga teacher and fitness studio owner. \u201cWalking improves fitness, cardiac health, alleviates depression and fatigue, improves mood, creates less stress on joints and reduces pain, can prevent weight gain, reduce risk for cancer and chronic disease, improve endurance, circulation, and posture, and the list goes on\u2026\u201d\nWhen comparing the results of the most recent National Runners\u2019 Health Study with the National Walkers\u2019 Health Study, researchers found that the energy used for moderate-intensity walking and vigorous-intensity running resulted in similar reductions in risk for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes and heart disease over the study\u2019s six year period.", "The variables that McGillivray suggests you play with include: levels of incline, walking styles, speed, weights (ankle weights and/or hand held weights to work the upper body while on the move) and music choices to help encourage a variation in speed.\nHere are the specifics on how to use some of these variables to kick your walking workout up a notch.", "So where do you start? \u201cThe right place to start with walking intervals will depend on your current fitness level, but here's a treadmill interval template to test out and see what adjustments you need to make,\u201d says Spraul. \u201cStart by walking for 5 minutes at a comfortable speed with no incline to get warmed up. Once you're done there, increase the incline to 5 percent for 3 minutes (no need to increase the speed when you're first starting out). After those 3 minutes are up, return to 0 incline for 1 minute of rest, while keeping the same speed. Repeat this for 3-5 rounds, depending on how you're feeling. Then you can adjust as needed: To add difficulty, you can increase the \u2018work\u2019 time that you spend on the incline, decrease the time you spend \u2018resting\u2019 at 0 incline or increase the pace of each phase. Find what works for you, and slowly increase your difficulty over time to keep making progress!\u201d", "Dr. Tannenberg offers another tip for incorporating intervals into your workout: \u201cCreate a new playlist with upbeat songs followed by slower songs. Alternate the songs on your playlist. When you are walking and hear a faster song, you increase your pace. When the slower song comes on, you slow down the pace a bit. This is an easy way to make your normal morning walk an interval workout.\u201d\nAdd Weights: Another way to add intensity to a walking routine is to use weights. \u201cWhether you're on the treadmill or you hop off on your \u2018rest interval,\u2019 you can add weight to keep your heart rate up and add some strength training into the mix,\u201d says Crockett. \u201cWhile you're walking on an incline, adding some dumbbell shoulder presses or dumbbell jabs can help you tone your arms and burn even more calories. [Or] hop off the treadmill after your fast interval and try some quick high repetition exercises, such as dumbbell squats, squat to press, weighted jumping jacks or weighted sit ups.\u201d", "You can\u2019t set the treadmill at 3.5 and zone out for an hour and expect to see major results.\nThe power of an effective walking workout lies in your hands \u2014 literally.

Residents actively participate in outdoor activities, including hiking and skiing, which prioritize walking as an integral part of everyday life. These societies place a strong emphasis on maintaining a healthy relationship with nature through walking. (3)\n6.

These figures reflect the Hadza's modern lives, full stop. They reflect a way of life that in the 21st century requires walking, in a way that urban or suburban life elsewhere may, or may not.\nI'm one in that \"may not\" category. Averages aren't all that helpful in this context. But it's interesting to note that, according to one study, Americans take 5,117 steps a day, a distance of approximately 2.5 miles. That's a significant shortfall compared to the averages in Western Australia (9,695), Switzerland (9,650) and Japan (7,168).", "I'm not happy to admit it, but I don't even walk 2.5 miles a day, much less the longer distances more typical of other countries. Sure, I take nature walks and city walks, ride my bicycle and use the elliptical machine, but these efforts are sporadic. This is something entirely within my power to change. While I admire mega-walkers like Paul Salopek, who is doing a seven-year, around-the-world journey, or William Helmreich, who walked 6,000 miles while exploring the five boroughs of New York City, my own goals are more modest. On a daily basis, I want to sit significantly less and move significantly more in 2014.", "When it comes to sustained walking over time and our health, it does matter for the choices we make today that we evolved in a hunting-and-gathering context. Foraging and its associated expenditure of energy from walking across the landscape is part of our evolutionary niche. Evolutionary biologist Daniel Lieberman focuses, in a related argument, on endurance running as part of that niche.\nI've argued before here at 13.7 that, just because we ate meat as hunter-gatherers in the past and hunter-gatherers still eat meat now, there's no necessity for all of us to eat meat today. For those of us fortunate enough to have dietary choices available, minimizing meat intake \u2014 or avoiding meat altogether \u2014 may be an inviting option, one in line with principles of animal welfare. We can get from vegetarian or vegan foods the nutritional equivalents of what meat provides (in some cases with a vitamin B-12 supplement).\nBut there's no substitute for sustained physical activity.", "It's good science, and good common sense, to be wary of appeals to our past when devising plans for dietary and health choices.

Yet when I say that this article kicked me into reflecting on making changes in my own movement patterns in 2014, I don't mean I intend to consciously adopt a L\u00e9vy walk pattern as I navigate the sidewalks of my town.\nInstead, this article pushed me to reflect anew on our understanding that the hunting-and-gathering context in which we evolved required lots of walking.", "Reading this article at the turn of the year meant that my interest in the anthropology of human behavior crashed up against my own reflections on what I want to accomplish over the next 12 months.

(Yes, these ways are incredibly easy to think up; it's the daily, weekly and monthly follow-through where I run into problems.)\nIn my first 13.7 post of the year, then, I'd like first to unpack the conclusions of the Hadza study. Then I'll take up how Hadza lifeways might help us think through ways in which patterned human behavior might \u2014 and in other ways shouldn't \u2014 affect the choices we make for ourselves in 2014.", "There we have it, one big reason why this research is interesting: Hadza foragers, along with other humans \"the most cognitively complex foragers on Earth\" as Raichlen et al. put it, move across the landscape in the same way that other organisms, ranging from honeybees to monkeys and sharks, move.\nPrevious research showed that when people navigate through Disney World, we adopt the L\u00e9vy pattern, as we do also on college campuses, in New York City and, presumably, in other locations.\nRaichlen and co-authors consequently emphasize that it seems to be a human rather than a Hadza trait to adopt L\u00e9vy-walk patterns. They note:\nThere is little evidence that local environment drives the presence of the L\u00e9vy walk patterns. Significant differences in the foods that the Hadza subjects brought back to each camp do not lead to large intercamp differences in use of L\u00e9vy walks.\nIn fact, they underscore the Hadza pattern as a pointer to a style of moving with both universality and time-depth:", "The Anthropology Of Walking\nCatching up on my journal reading over Christmas break, I came across a study by an international team of anthropologists which points to a fascinating pattern in how humans move across the landscape. Whether foraging for food in Tanzania or walking from Space Mountain to the Pirates of the Caribbean ride in Disney World, we tend to adopt what's called a L\u00e9vy walk, a type of random walk where groups of short step lengths are interspersed with longer movements.\nThe study, published last month by David A. Raichlen, Brian M. Wood, Adam D. Gordon, Audax Z.P. Mabulla, Frank W. Marlowe and Herman Pontzer, offers new data on how the Hadza, contemporary hunter-gatherers of Tanzania, walk on their extensive foraging trips.", "Our results suggest that scale-invariant, superdiffusive movement profiles are a fundamental feature of human landscape use, regardless of the physical or cultural environment, and may have played an important role in the evolution of human mobility. Given the adoption of a hunting and gathering lifestyle nearly 2 million years ago in human ancestors, L\u00e9vy walk foraging is likely a key element of human prehistory. Superdiffusive foraging may have allowed hominins, such as Homo erectus, to explore the larger home ranges reconstructed for these early hunter-gatherers.\nAs always, we need to take care with this kind of argument.\nIt's poor science to imply that the Hadza, or any contemporary hunter-gatherers, are somehow throwback humans that give us special insight into human prehistory. And I do not mean that Raichlen's team is making this specious argument. When I contacted Raichlen by email last week, he clearly rested their argument on a broader base than the Hadza pattern alone:", "Anthropologist Raichlen and his team collected movement data on the Hadza, hunter-gatherers who use bows and arrows, digging sticks and axes as they forage for animal prey, underground tubers, berries and other food items.

In a total of 342 foraging bouts, the primary pattern of movement for both men and women was the L\u00e9vy walk.\nRaichlen and his co-authors describe this form of locomotion as a \"superdiffusive, scale-free movement pattern\" in which \"the rare long steps minimize oversampling a given patch and take organisms to new food patches without requiring memory or high levels of cognition.\""], "title": "The Anthropology Of Walking : 13.7: Cosmos And Culture - NPR"}, "https://www.sciencenews.org/article/culture-helps-shape-when-babies-learn-walk": {"url": "https://www.sciencenews.org/article/culture-helps-shape-when-babies-learn-walk", "description": "Many parents in Western cultures are familiar with infant motor development charts.

Both groups were almost evenly split between walkers and crawlers. His analysis, appearing in 2015 in Infancy , showed that the same divergence in language abilities seen between walking versus crawling American infants also occurs in Chinese babies.

Scientists are comparing the motor skills of babies in various\ncultures and creating controlled experiments to see if training can speed up\nthe development of certain skills.\nAnd motor skills don\u2019t arise in isolation. When\na baby begins to sit, crawl or walk, she gains a new view on the world, which\nalters her perception. It also influences how babies and caregivers\ncommunicate. A baby who has learned to walk, for instance, will often carry\nobjects to her mother, who frequently responds with words or ways of speaking\nthat are new to the baby.

These beads have a bit of a shine to them and come in an array of colors, from pink or black to turquoise. Placed inside glass vases or even open in dishes, the beads can then take center stage inside a home, a more decorative choice than a conventional urn. In a country where space is at a premium and cremation is becoming the only realistic choice for burying the dead, getting something beautiful out of the process gives loved ones a new tradition to embrace and an heirloom to treasure.\nAn Array of Filipino Traditions", "Celebrating the life of the deceased can take many forms. A tradition from Varanasi, India, involves parading the dead through the streets, the bodies dressed in colors that highlight the virtues of the deceased (red for purity or yellow for knowledge, for example). In an effort to encourage souls to reach salvation, ending the cycle of reincarnation, the bodies are sprinkled with water from the Ganges River and then cremated at the town\u2019s main cremation grounds.\nTower of Silence\nOne Zoroastrian tradition requires vultures to keep its ancient burial ritual alive. In that tradition a dead body is believed to defile everything it touches\u2014including the ground and fire\u2014and raising a corpse to the sky for vultures to devour was historically the only option. Bull\u2019s urine is used to clean the body before tools, which are later destroyed, are used to cut off clothing.

This ritual\u2014translated as the \u201cturning of the bones\u201d\u2014is meant to speed up decomposition and push the spirit of the dead toward the afterlife.\nWater Burial\nMany cultures, especially in Nordic countries, have embraced water in their rituals of choice for the dead, from laying coffins atop cliffs faced toward the water to actually using the water as a burial ground.

It\u2019s essentially how hard your body is working to keep up.\n\u201cWe measure the intensity of a workout based on heart rate zones,\u201d Dr. Dakkak explains. \u201cYour heart rate zone is a measure of how quickly your heart is beating. A higher heart rate during exercise means your heart is working harder.\u201d\nKnowing your exact heart rate zone takes a bit of math and a heart rate monitor.

If you're doing strength training, for example, lift lighter weights or do fewer reps or sets.\n- For most people, simply drinking plenty of water is sufficient. But if you're working out especially hard or doing a marathon or triathlon, choose drinks that replace fluids plus essential electrolytes.\n- Choose clothes and shoes designed for your type of exercise. Replace shoes every six months as cushioning wears out.\n- For strength training, good form is essential. Initially use no weight, or very light weights, when learning the exercises. Never sacrifice good form by hurrying to finish reps or sets, or struggling to lift heavier weights.", "- Exercising vigorously in hot, humid conditions can lead to serious overheating and dehydration. Slow your pace when the temperature rises above 70\u00b0F. On days when the thermometer is expected to reach 80\u00b0F, exercise during cooler morning or evening hours or at an air-conditioned gym. Watch for signs of overheating, such as headache, dizziness, nausea, faintness, cramps, or palpitations.\n- Dress properly for cold-weather workouts to avoid hypothermia. Depending on the temperature, wear layers you can peel off as you warm up. Don't forget gloves.\nDelayed muscle soreness that starts 12 to 24 hours after a workout and gradually abates is a normal response to taxing your muscles.

Researchers found that orthotics and shoe inserts aren\u2019t good at preventing running injuries.\nCommon running injuries include:\n- Runner's knee\n- Achilles tendonitis\n- Shin splints\n- Plantar fasciitis\n- Stress fractures\n- Iliotibial band syndrome\nWalkers have a much lower risk of getting hurt. In a study of 14,536 college students who did various types of physical activity, those who walked had some of the lowest rates of injury.", "Low impact vs. high impact. You might think of walking as just running slowly. But when you walk, you have one foot on the ground at all times. When you run, you\u2019re in the air during each stride. Each time you land, your body absorbs the impact of about three times your body weight.\nOsteoarthritis risk. Because it's more strenuous, you might think that running would increase your risk of osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis happens when the cushion between your bones (cartilage) wears down, and your joints get painful and swollen.\nBut a study of 74,752 runners and 14,625 walkers found that the runners had a lower risk of hip replacement and osteoarthritis than the walkers. Researchers said that this may be because, on average, the runners had lower body mass indices (BMI) than the walkers. Less body weight means less stress on your bones.", "Experts recommend that you get at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise each week. They also say you should do muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days a week.\nWalking vs. Running\nThere are some key differences between walking and running.\nStarting exercise. If you\u2019re just getting into exercise or are out of shape, start with walking short distances, then gradually increase your distance and duration. Even walking at a casual pace of 2 miles per hour can cut your risk of heart problems by 31%, if you do it regularly.\nBurning calories. Running burns more than twice as many calories per minute as walking.\nFor a person who weighs 160 pounds, walking at a pace of 3.5 miles per hour for 30 minutes burns about 156 calories. Running at 6 mph for the same time burns about 356 calories.", "Both walking and running are great ways to get cardiovascular exercise. But is one a better exercise than the other?\nBenefits of Cardio Exercise\nCardio, or aerobic, exercise is anything that gets you breathing harder and your heart beating faster.\nSome of the benefits of a cardio workout include:\n- Reduced risk of dementia\n- Improved memory\n- Increased circulation\n- Better blood sugar control\n- Happier mood\n- An easier time falling asleep\n- Healthier cholesterol levels\n- Better erectile function\nFor many people, running is a vigorous exercise, while walking tends to be moderate in intensity.\nVigorous activity is when you\u2019re breathing fast and hard, and your heart rate has gone up a lot. You may also find it hard to say more than a few words without stopping to take a breath.\nIn general, one minute of vigorous activity is equal to 2 minutes of moderate-intensity activity.", "Swing your arms. Bend your arms at 90 degrees and swing your arms naturally as you walk. Swinging them vigorously encourages you to walk faster. It also gives your upper body more of a workout. You\u2019ll burn 5% to 10% more calories, too.\nTry incline walking. If you walk on a treadmill, increase the incline by 5% or 10%. If you walk outdoors, look for hills or even a steep driveway to make your walk more challenging.\nWater walking. Do this in shallow water at the beach or in a pool. The resistance of the water increases the intensity of your walk but lessens the impact on your joints.\nWalking poles. Walking poles can help you burn up to 30% more calories. They add intensity and help you maintain good posture as you walk.\nWeighted vests. A weighted vest adds intensity but doesn\u2019t strain your shoulders and wrists like ankle and hand weights do. Pick one that\u2019s 5% to 10% of your body weight.", "Both Running and Walking Are Great Forms of Exercise\nScientists who looked at information from 33,060 runners and 15,945 walkers found that walking can lower your risk of diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure as much as running. They measured exercise by time, not distance.\nSince walking is less vigorous than running, you\u2019ll have to walk longer or more often to get the same benefits. Running is more efficient, but has a higher risk of injuries, and you\u2019ll need more time to heal if you get injured.\nThe best exercise for you is the one you\u2019ll actually do. So whether it\u2019s running, walking, or both, pick the one you like best.\nHow to Get More Out of Your Walk\nHere are some ways to improve your walking workout.\nWalk in a group.

Meanwhile, your ankle will start at 5 degrees of plantar flexion and end up at 5 degrees of dorsiflexion. Interval of Gait: 12-31%.", "snippets": ["The posture of your hip, knee, and foot will determine how well you\u2019re able to handle weight bearing and loading forces as you move through the rest of your gait. Though optimal gait mechanics may vary from person to person, an ideal gait presents about 20 degrees of hip flexion, and neutral alignment in your knee and ankle at this very first stage.\nLoading Response\nThis is the second phase of your gait cycle, which is also quite aptly named. The loading response phase refers to how your body responds while under load! (Who would\u2019ve thought?)\nMore specifically though, this marks the point where your body starts transitioning to single-leg weight bearing and shock absorption.\nThis phase begins just after initial contact: your body weight starts to progress forward in a rolling or rocking motion at the heel. This is known as the \u201cheel rocker,\u201d which prompts plantar flexion in the ankle to help bring the entire foot in contact with the ground.", "During terminal stance, there is a second rocker known as the \u201cforefoot rocker\u201d that\u2019s especially important. Once that heel lifts off the ground, the weight on your stance leg shifts over the metatarsal bones (i.e., the long bones of your foot). With proper calf, ankle, and foot strength, this brings your center of gravity over the front of your foot.\nNow, your hip joint should be hitting around 20 degrees of extension, whereas your knee joint stays in a neutral position and your ankle is ideally within 5-10 degrees of dorsiflexion.\nPre-Swing\nDuring this fifth phase of your gait, you\u2019re still in a period of double-limb support, but not for long!\nThis is the point where your body is preparing itself to transition into the swing phase.\nBut before your leg officially starts to \u201cswing,\u201d your body has to shift the majority of its weight from the forefoot and through the toes. (This is very aptly named \u201ctoe-off\u201d or \u201cweight release\u201d as you prepare to bring your stance foot off the ground.)", "From the moment you start taking those first, wobbly steps as a child, and all the way through navigating your daily, adult life \u2014 walking is an essential part of your movement.\nIt\u2019s an innate ability of ours, and an everyday activity that we take for granted. We assume that we\u2019ll always be able to walk; that if we want to get from point A to point B, our legs will get us there without a second thought.\nWithout an injury or pathology, walking is coordinated, precise, and effortless.\nBut what about those of us who have limitations with walking?\nBe it pain, joint restriction, arthritis, nerve compression, neurological disease, depression, poor balance, and so on\u2026\nThere are countless factors that could affect proper walking gait. And those who have to deal with any degree of restriction likely don\u2019t feel that walking is an effortless motion.\nHowever, even if it doesn\u2019t start out feeling effortless, establishing proper walking form is vital.", "As the length of your foot hits the ground, your body will start to take in the impact forces of your step \u2014 and in order to properly absorb the shock, you\u2019ll need ample knee flexion to ensure your muscles take in the impact forces (rather than your passive tissues).\nThrough loading response, your hip flexion should still sit around 20 degrees, but your knee joint will start from a neutral position and move into 20 degrees of flexion as well. Simultaneously, your ankle will shift from neutral to 5 degrees of plantar flexion.\nMid-Stance\nYour mid-stance phase marks the beginning of total single-limb support. Now, your stance limb has complete responsibility for supporting your body weight, maintaining a level pelvis, and staying balanced through your forward movement.\nThis phase starts when your contralateral foot (i.e., the foot of your non-stance leg) lifts off the ground, and it ends when the contralateral tibia (i.e., the shin bone of your non-stance leg) is fully vertical.", "Your pre-swing phase begins with the point of initial contact on your other leg, and it ends with that toe-off phase in your stance leg. To achieve this movement, your hip joint starts at 20 degrees of extension and moves back to a neutral position, whereas your knee moves from a neutral angle to approximately 40 degrees of flexion to absorb impacts. As for your ankle joint, it moves from 10 degrees of dorsiflexion to 20 degrees of plantarflexion. (That pointed toe is exactly what you need for the toe-off.)\nInitial Swing\nNow is when you transition back to single-limb support \u2014 but this time, your other leg is the one that\u2019s bearing the weight. (Whenever one leg is moving through its swing phase, the other is in stance!)\nThis is the point where your now swing foot is fully lifted off of the ground and travels out behind you. Your initial swing phase ends once this foot starts to move forward again, when it\u2019s parallel to the foot of your other leg again.", "Through this part of your gait, your hip will increase its flexion from 10 to 20 degrees, whereas your knee decreases from approximately 60 to 30 degrees of flexion, and your ankle begins at 5 degrees of plantarflexion back to a neutral position.\nTerminal Swing\nAnd finally, your terminal swing phase completes the full cycle of your gait!\nThe primary goal with this last phase of single-leg support is to fully bring your swing leg forward in preparation for the initial contact of your next gait cycle.\nTerminal swing begins just as the shin bone of your swing leg starts to angle out of its vertical position, and it ends when the swing foot touches the ground. During this phase, your hip will decrease slightly to 20 degrees of flexion, your knee will move from 30 degrees of flexion to a neutral position, and your ankle will remain neutral until the point of initial contact.\nImproving an Impaired Walking Gait", "Just as your car needs proper maintenance, achieving walking gait norms requires proper alignment and coordination! If you\u2019re dealing with pain while walking, or it takes more energy out of you than usual, speak to a gait specialist to assess what might be causing these symptoms.\nPerforming a thorough assessment requires time and specialized equipment. When you find the right place, they\u2019ll not only help pinpoint the root cause of the problem, but they\u2019ll also provide insight into how you can correct and alleviate your symptoms in the long-term.\nOriginally published on October 14, 2015; updated on May 25, 2022.", "As the name suggests, this is the point when your leading foot first makes contact with the ground.\nMany practitioners refer to this moment as \u201cheel strike,\u201d as the heel is the most common part of the foot to hit the ground first. And ideally, it should be \u2014 however, that isn\u2019t always the case, as neurological or range of motion issues can end up causing a flat foot or forefoot strike.\nSo, in our clinic, we use the term \u201cinitial contact\u201d as an all-encompassing identifier.\nDuring the point of initial contact, you\u2019re in a state of double-limb support (i.e., both of your feet are in contact with the ground). But, even though both feet are on the ground, this phase marks the very start of weight bearing motion in your leading leg. Here, your body is preparing to absorb shock, stabilize the leg, and preserve that forward progression in your movement.", "But in order to effectively analyze walking gait, we have to assign distinct phases to the movement cycle. We typically use your foot\u2019s first point of contact with the ground as the \u201cstart\u201d of your gait cycle.\nPerhaps it seems like breaking out the gait cycle into 8 phases is excessive, but it\u2019s for good reason! When we have specific phases, we can identify all of the biomechanics that go into each minute motion. This allows us to collect highly nuanced data about your unique gait patterns and compare them to normative values (like muscle activation, strength patterns, joint angles, and internal torques).\nAll of that specific data can be collected through a professional walking gait analysis, where your gait specialist can identify what potential impairments may be limiting your walking.\nHowever, there\u2019s a LOT to unpack behind walking biomechanics, so before you dive into a full-blown analysis, let\u2019s first review the phases of your gait cycle.\nInitial Contact", "Alright, we know that was a lot to process\u2026 most people don\u2019t realize just how nuanced walking is, nor how specific its biomechanics can be! (We certainly owe a lot of credit to our nervous and musculoskeletal systems for coordinating all that specific joint and muscle activity.)\nNow that you know what ideal walking gait looks like, this then begs the question: what happens if any of these phases deviate from the norm?\nThink about your walking gait like it\u2019s your car\u2019s alignment \u2014 when you\u2019re driving, you might hear weird noises, or you notice that your gas mileage is dropping quickly. Maybe your tires are wearing down way faster than they should be.\nWith impaired walking mechanics, you may feel aches and pains, grow more exhausted from an easy walk, or experience more wear in your hip and knee joints.", "As your leg is \u201cwinding up\u201d to swing forward, the goal is to achieve enough clearance for your swing foot to move back while retaining balance on your other leg, allowing you to advance through the contralateral foot and maintain your forward progression.\nHere, your hip joint will move from a neutral position to a slight, 10 degrees of flexion. Meanwhile, your knee will continue to bend to around 40-60 degrees of flexion, and your ankle will decrease from 20 degrees of plantarflexion to only 5 degrees.\nMid-Swing\nThe mid-swing phase describes the part of your gait where your leg \u201cswings\u201d forward. While your other leg is focused on weightbearing, your swing leg is focused on smooth motion to continue that forward advancement.\nYour mid-swing phase begins when the swing foot moves past your stance leg, and it ends when the shin bone is in a vertical position. (Think of this as the moment just before your foot descends to make contact with the ground.)", "Perhaps it sounds strange to associate something as simple as walking with having proper form \u2014 but the biomechanics behind it are more complex than we tend to think. (Oftentimes, not knowing or implementing proper form is what causes aches and pains to begin with.)\nSo, let\u2019s break down what an ideal walking gait looks like! Knowledge is the first step to progress.\nWhat is Walking Gait, Anyway?\nThe term \u201cgait\u201d refers to the continuous movement pattern that constitutes your walking or running motions. More specifically, it\u2019s a cycle of movement that supports your body through high loading forces, muscular control, and single-leg alignment as you advance from one limb to the next in a forward motion.\nBefore we dive into all the nitty gritty details of how to walk, here\u2019s a brief overview of some of the terms we\u2019ll be referring to throughout this blog:", "- Your stance phase refers to the first half of your gait cycle; it\u2019s the period of time where your foot is in contact with the ground, and when your leg is bearing the weight of your body. (Your stance foot/leg refers to the limb in contact with the ground and under load.)\n- Your swing phase refers to the second half of your gait cycle; it\u2019s the period of time where your foot is NOT in contact with the ground, and when your leg is advancing forward into your next step. (Your swing foot/leg refers to the limb that is off the ground.)\n- Flexion refers to the mechanic that allows you to bend a joint. (Dorsiflexion is used to describe the motion of the ankle joint when you lift your toes up and towards your shin.)\n- Extension refers to the mechanic that allows you to straighten out a joint. (Plantar flexion is used to describe the extension of your ankle joint, or when you point your toes down and away from your shin bone.)", "- Contralateral describes the limb or foot opposite to the one being referred to. (I.e., when talking about your right foot, your left foot is contralateral to it.)\nThese terms are just the start to truly understanding your gait! Being able to differentiate your stance from your swing phase is good, but it gets a lot more complicated than that \u2014 both of these phases can be broken down into 4 smaller phases each.\nBut, don\u2019t fret! That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to dive into here. In order to assess the potential causes behind pain or limitation with walking, you have to start with thorough knowledge behind ideal mechanics first.\nSo, let\u2019s walk through it, step-by-step!\nThe 8 Phases of Walking Gait\nTechnically speaking, there isn\u2019t a distinct \u201cstart\u201d or \u201cend\u201d point in your gait cycle, since it\u2019s defined as a continuous motion\u2026", "At this point, your weight should be fully aligned over the middle of your stance foot. Here is where you experience the \u201cankle rocker\u201d; as you start moving forward during the mid-stance phase, the tibia glides over your ankle during the forward progression.\nBy the end of your mid-stance phase, both your hip and knee joint should be moving into extension \u2014 they\u2019ll start out at around 20 degrees of flexion and end in a neutral angle. Meanwhile, your ankle will start at 5 degrees of plantar flexion and end up at 5 degrees of dorsiflexion.\nTerminal Stance\nThe fourth phase of your gait also remains as a single-limb support phase\u2026 but instead of predominantly bearing weight, this is where your biomechanics have to progress your body past the stance foot and onto the next.\nThis phase starts when the heel of your stance leg starts to rise off the ground, and it ends when your contralateral limb makes initial contact with the ground."], "title": "The 8 Phases of Walking Gait: What Ideal Walking Form Looks Like"}, "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16554517/": {"url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16554517/", "description": "The major difference between walking and running was that one temporal component, occurring during stance, was shifted to an earlier phase in the step cycle during running.

However, the differences between their kinematics and kinetics imply that corresponding muscle activations may also be quite different. We examined the differences between walking and running by recording kinematics and electromyographic (EMG) activity in 32 ipsilateral limb and trunk muscles during human locomotion, and compared the effects of speed (3-12 km/h) and gait. We found that the timing of muscle activation was accounted for by five basic temporal activation components during running as we previously found for walking. Each component was loaded on similar sets of leg muscles in both gaits but generally on different sets of upper trunk and shoulder muscles", "Motor patterns in human walking and running\n- PMID: 16554517\n- DOI: 10.1152/jn.00081.2006\nMotor patterns in human walking and running\nAbstract", ".

Twelve healthy male subjects were studied during walking (1.0-3.0 m s-1) and running (1.5-6.0 m s-1). The subjects were selected with respect to foot-strike pattern during running. Six subjects were classified as rearfoot strikers and six as forefoot strikers. Constant speeds were accomplished by pacer lights beside an indoor straightway and controlled by means of a photo-electronic device. The vertical, anteroposterior and mediolateral force components were recorded with a force platform. Computer software was used to calculate durations, amplitudes and impulses of the reaction forces. The amplitudes were normalized with respect to body weight (b.w.).

The peak amplitude of the vertical reaction force in walking and running increased with speed from approximately 1.0 to 1.5 b.w. and 2.0 to 2.9 b.w. respectively. The anteroposterior peak force and mediolateral peak-to-peak force increased about 2 times with speed in walking and about 2-4 times in running (the absolute values were on average about 10 times smaller than the vertical). The transition from walking to running resulted in a shorter support phase duration and a change in the shape of the vertical reaction force curve. The vertical peak force increased whereas the vertical impulse and the anteroposterior impulses and peak forces decreased. In running the vertical force showed an impact peak at touch-down among the rearfoot strikers but generally not among the forefoot strikers.

Where this goal can be accomplished with power walking as well, running increases your body\u2019s movements at a faster rate in a shorter amount of time.\n3. Looking to Improve Cardiovascular Fitness\nCardiovascular workout goals are reached by running twice as fast as they are with walking.\nRunning strengthens the walls of the heart. This will increase its overall efficiency. Strengthening the heart allows for a lower resting rate and an increase in the amounts of oxygen taken in and pushed through the body.\nWalking vs Running: Which One is Better for Weight Loss?", "- Diminish your chances of getting some cancers\n- Boost your immune system\n- Lower your risk of diabetes\n- Lower risk of hip replacement in the future\n- Tone your legs\n- Stimulate growth hormones\n- Increase your lung capacity\n- Add years to your life\n- Reduce risk of Alzheimer\u2019s\n- Improve libido\nStudies have confirmed walking (in any form) can be one of the most beneficial activities for your health. Meanwhile, running also works multiple body systems at once and produces positive results in a shorter period of time.\nMental Health Benefits\nPhysical benefits are not the only positives of regularly walking or running.\nResearch has proven that effective long-distance walking improves mental health.\nStudies found that regular walking and running assist with reducing the impact of stress in your life, allowing for many positive mental health benefits, such as:\n- Actively fighting/assisting in managing depression\n- Drastically reducing levels of anxiety", "Let\u2019s start by breaking down exactly what we\u2019re talking about here. While a stroll with the pup or with friends is always wonderful, we are really focused on walking as a workout which means Power Walking.\nI like to call it walking with purpose.\nWhen it comes to the main differences between walking /power walking and running, there are three main areas to consider: speed, gait, and muscles worked. Let\u2019s look at each of them in more detail:\nWalking vs Running: Speed Differences\nYou may think it\u2019s just regular walking done super fast. To some degree, this is true. Power walking is more than a brisk walk, yet not quite as much as a jog.\nFor our purposes we are aiming to work up to at least 4MPH which is a 15 minute mile.\nThis exercise routine is built upon walking at a consistent pace while maintaining:\n- Longer strides\n- Good posture\n- Alternating leg and arm movements\n- Speed", "Walking vs Running: Which One is Better for Heart Health?\nGreat news, it\u2019s a tie! The American Heart Association showed walking was just as good as running to lower risk of heart disease. A good strong walk is going to reduce blood pressure, cholesterol and even diabetes risk factors.\nMany Doctors are going to prescribe walking because people simply seem to be able to stick to it better than running. And as we\u2019ve said that\u2019s the goal! Consistency is where you\u2019re going to see benefits of either workout.\nThe studies are looking at doing at least a 20 minute walk at a brisk pace, which we\u2019ve defined as power walking.\nIn fact one study from Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology, followed 33,060 runners and 15,945 walkers for over six years. The results showed both experienced reductions in heart disease risk factors, but the walkers saw greater impacts on blood pressure and cholesterol.\nWalking vs Running: Assessing Risk of Injuries", "Running and power walking also strengthen upper-body muscles like the shoulders and arms in addition to the core muscles like the abdominals and low-back extensors. (Bonus points for Nordic walking which really fires up the upper body!)\nHowever, running utilizes all muscles to a greater extent than walking because it is a high-impact activity. Muscles must work harder to lift the body off the ground between strides, move it forward, and absorb the impact of landing.\nSo, not only are the muscle forces and exertion more during running than walking, but the joint impact stresses are also greater.\nBenefits of Walking and Running\nThese two have a wide range of shared benefits. Walking has been one of the most underrated exercise for years.\nRunning tends to get all the attention and listen I\u2019ve got a whole website about running here, but I do LOVE a walk! They can coexist! Not to mention, there are tons of training programs like the run/walk method that utilize both simultaneously.", "When you run, on the other hand, there is a \u2018flight or \u2018float\u2019 phase, even if you are running slower than you might power walk. There is a moment when both legs are in the swing phase and neither foot is touching the ground.\nAnd so, for this reason, running is a high-impact activity because you must land on your feet from an airborne position.\nWalking and running are two separate activities, with noticeable gait changes that can be seen and felt. For this reason, as we discussed earlier, the difference between the two involves more than just average speeds.\nWalking vs Running: Muscles Worked\nWalking and running are mostly lower-body activities with comparable movement patterns, therefore there is considerable muscle overlap between the two.\nBoth are forms of lower-body exercise that work the quadriceps, glutes, hamstrings, and calves, as well as the hip flexors. Plus, the hamstrings, calves, and glutes are used more when the incline is steeper in either of the two exercises.", "One of the fundamental differences between power walking vs running is the number of calories burned during the workout. That being said, I am a HUGE advocate of walking for weight loss as your starting point because it\u2019s easier to stick to and then transition to running.\nWith power walking, your body is not elevating your heart rate as quickly or burning as many calories as you would, compared with the higher intensity session of running. You will need to walk much longer and more often to burn a similar number of calories as you would with jogging.\nThe quicker the pace and the difficulty of the terrain (i.e climbing a trail) will increase calories burned while walking.\nPower walking burns a similar number of calories as running. For example, power walking at 4.5 mph for one hour would burn the same as jogging at 4.5 mph for one hour.\nYou will burn twice as many calories running as you will walking.", "The following chart is for a 30 minute workout to help you compare total calories burned walking vs running at different speeds.\nWalking vs Running: Which One is Better on a Treadmill?\nWondering if the value of your workout changes on the treadmill? It depends entirely on the treadmill incline that you utilize.\nIf you\u2019re running and walking at a 0% or even 1% incline then running will always burn more calories. However, if you\u2019re open to utilize the incline then you can substantially increase your overall calorie burn and utilize more muscles with a power walk than a flat run.\nCheckout these beginner treadmill tips to get you started >>\nWalking vs Running: Which One is Better for Joint Health?\nBoth running and walking are excellent for our joints. In fact, studies show regular running strengthens the joints and protects against the development of osteoarthritis later in life.", "The most important is to increase the intensity and duration of your runs gradually. You shouldn\u2019t increase it by more than 10% week by week. And the second is to make sure you\u2019re wearing the right type of running shoes. In fact, this is even important with walking and I highly recommend you consider getting some walking shoes.\nFor running, make sure you get shoes that are the right type for your feet. I highly recommend shoes with sufficient stability and cushioning, and that fit properly. You should rotate your shoes regularly, and avoid running on slick, soft surfaces to prevent the risk of injuries.\nRead more about the common running injuries to know how to best avoid them; not all runners get injured, especially when taking all the necessary precautions and working on having a good form.\nWalking vs Running: 3 Steps to Pick What Will Work For You\nHaving a healthy heart, stronger bones, and maintaining a healthy body weight are all possible with regular power walking or running.", "Facebook Community Chatter: RunToTheFinish\nSign Up to Receive a Weekly Newsletter with Top Running Tips and Laughs", "However, running is a high impact exercise and therefore requires more from your entire body.

Do you have running experience?\nYou don\u2019t ever want to get hurt while exercising.\nPeople with underlying health conditions or mobility limitations are at higher risk of injuries when running than they may be at power walking.", "The simple science is that your body works harder with a higher impact activity when running.\nA study published by the Mayo Clinic shows that a 160-pounds (73 kg) person walking for one hour at an average speed of 3.5 mph will burn an average of 314 calories. They approximated that the same person, running for 1 hour with an average speed of 5 mph, burns 606 calories.\nThe key is which one can you stick with? Just because walking might take longer to burn calories, if it\u2019s something you enjoy and will stick to then it\u2019s the better choice!\nRunning and walking are both sufficient in keeping weight off if performed regularly.\nWalking vs Running a Mile: Calories Burned\nThere are a lot of different calculators to come up with calories burned, but a few overarching themes seem to be present.\n- calories burned are going to increase with walking or running speed\n- total calories will also increase with body weight", "Power walking is no joke.

Both exercises bring equal positive benefits for cardio health, but women tend to stick with walking/power walking more than running.\n2. Want to Increase Existing Fitness", "The final key distinction between walking and running that many people are curious about is the relative risk of injury.\nWalking, as previously mentioned, is a low-impact activity, but running is a high-impact activity. As a result, anyone suffering from joint discomfort or arthritis will likely find walking more comfortable and approachable.\nRunning, on the other hand, is a more effective way of building bone density due to the increased impact stresses. This also makes the risk of stress fractures and joint pain a little bit higher.\nIn general, there is a lower risk for potential injuries with walking than with running. Injury risk rises as intensity and duration increase. But there are ways you can greatly reduce your risk of running-related injuries!", "The positive effects walking and running have on our bodies range from helping lower your risk for cardiovascular disease and cancer to decreasing depression and reducing anxiety.

You can also try rucking (which is wearing a weighted backpack while you walk) or Nordic walking (which uses walking poles).\nRunning is a great option if you\u2019re limited on time \u2014 and may be best if you\u2019re training for a certain sport or competition.

Conversely, the quads are used more in running than walking because of the spring-like propulsion off the foot when running.\"\n2It Impacts Your Joints More\nBecause of the difference in your gait and speed, running has more impact on on the joints than walking. \"The change in strike area on the foot increases the forces sent upward through the body as you land further forward on the foot,\" Rooff says. If your form is correct, this can be positive. But if your form is off, you may injure yourself while running. Paying attention to the way your foot hits the ground can help you run in a way that maximizes the benefits and minimizes the downsides.", "\"Physical exercise is considered an effective way to stimulate formation of bone,\" Paskins tells Bustle. Exercises like weight training and running boost your bone density because your body adapts to having more pressure on your joints, which can actually be a good thing. The more your bones get used to healthy pressure, the less likely they are to break. \"Running can lead to more injuries, but it has also been shown to lead to better bone density, better circulation, and improved muscle and tendon function,\" says Chatzopoulos.\n5You Expend More Energy", "If you're the kind of person who loves fast and hard sprints, make sure your form is locked in and have fun. But if you'd rather go on a two hour stroll than spend even three minutes jogging, that's OK, too. Whatever you prefer (both is also good), you'll want to be aware of these six ways running affects your body differently than walking, according to experts.\n1It Involves Mid-Sole Contact Rather Than Heel\nRunning and walking both move your body forward, but the mechanics are different. When you're walking, you probably step forward with your heels touching the ground first. You want to avoid this when you're running, though.\n\"The typical (or ideal) foot-strike in running is landing on the mid-foot, pronating, and leaving off of your big toe; whereas in walking, there is more of a heel strike involved,\" says Steve Stonehouse, a certified personal trainer, track and field coach, and director of education for running studio franchise STRIDE.", "Life\nWhether you're heading out for a jog or taking your dog (and yourself) for a walk, your whole body is going to benefit. Running and walking can both do wonders for your heart health and general mental clarity \u2014 but a sprint and a stroll are definitely not the same. Running affects your body differently than walking, and you might find that those differences impact the kind of workout you want today.\nListening to your body is key when it comes to choosing running or walking. \"You need to ease yourself into running, but if you do that and it still doesn't feel good (your joints ache or your knees or back hurt), then maybe running isn't for you,\" certified strength and conditioning specialist Ambyr Chatzopoulos tells Bustle. \"However, if you run with proper form and feel good after running (both mentally and physically), then you can gain a lot more from it in a smaller amount of time.\"", "There's a reason walking feels less strenuous than running, and it's because people tend to expend more energy on a run than a walk. \"In general, you\u2019ll typically expend twice as much energy running as you may walking,\" Stonehouse says. According to a 2020 study published in the journal Scientific Reports, the faster you move, the more energy you use. So if you're short on time and want a more intense workout, you might want to lace up your running shoes instead of your walking boots.\n6It Can Have A Greater Impact On Your Hormones", "Running with proper form means that your body can absorb the shock more safely. Solid form means that your body \"is able to convert [running impact] into rotational momentum, decreasing the impact on the body,\" says Emily Paskins, a certified personal trainer for at-home personal training community iFit Training.\n3It Can Lead To More Injuries\n\"Running produces a much higher ground reaction force on your body than walking does,\" says Chatzopoulos. \"If you're running with proper form, then your muscles, joints and tendons will accept this force and actually use it to help propel your body forward.\" However, running without great form can increase your risk of injury, especially compared to walking.", "\"To make sure your body doesn\u2019t crash excessively with each foot strike, you want to run tall and with quick feet,\" says Nate Helming, co-founder of the training community The Run Experience and strength coach for the running app Strava. \"The less time your foot is on the ground while running, the more likely it will land underneath your body, and the less likely you\u2019ll crash and collapse with every step.\"\nIn addition to locking in your form, Helming says that you can reduce the risk of running injury by slowly introducing your body to the exercise. \"You want to work your way up slowly to greater volume to give your body the time to adapt,\" he tells Bustle. \"Short sessions of 10 minutes or less combined with strength training and run drills are a great place to start.\"\n4It Can Build Better Bone Density", "Li, S.

This chronic stress taxes your thyroid and can lead to fatigue ... and depression.\"\nGetting enough rest and nutrition between your running sessions is vitally important for making sure your body can calm down and know that it's safe.

In this article, we will explore why authors should get involved in book fairs and how to make the most of this unique platform.\nWhy Authors Should Get Involved in Book Fairs\nExposure and Visibility", "One of the primary reasons authors should participate in book fairs is the exposure and visibility it offers. These events draw a diverse crowd of literary enthusiasts; including publishers, agents, fellow authors, and avid readers. By presenting your work at a book fair, you can increase your book\u2019s visibility and attract potential readers who might not have discovered your work otherwise. It\u2019s a chance to stand out in a crowded marketplace and make a lasting impression.\nNetworking Opportunities\nBook fairs bring together key players in the publishing industry. Authors can network with literary agents, publishers, editors, and fellow authors, creating invaluable connections that may lead to future collaborations, book deals, or endorsements. Building relationships with people who share your passion for literature can open doors to exciting opportunities and help advance your career as an author.\nDirect Reader Engagement", "Book fairs provide a unique platform for direct engagement with your readers. You can interact with your existing fanbase, sign books, and engage in meaningful conversations with readers who are genuinely interested in your work. These personal connections can foster loyalty and turn casual readers into dedicated fans who eagerly anticipate your future releases.\nLearning and Inspiration\nAttending book fairs can be a tremendous learning experience. You can attend seminars, workshops, and panel discussions featuring renowned authors, literary experts, and industry professionals. These sessions offer insights into writing, marketing, and the evolving landscape of publishing. By staying informed and inspired, you can improve your craft and stay ahead in the competitive world of literature.\nHow Authors Can Get Involved in Book Fairs\nChoose the Right Book Fair", "Selecting the right book fair is crucial. Research various book fairs to find the one that aligns with your genre, target audience, and goals. Some well-known book fairs include the Frankfurt Book Fair, BookExpo America, London Book Fair, and local or regional book fairs. Consider your budget, location, and the scale of the event when making your decision.\nPrepare Your Presentation\nOnce you\u2019ve chosen a book fair, it\u2019s time to prepare your presentation. Ensure that your booth or display is visually appealing and reflects the essence of your work. Create eye-catching banners, promotional materials, and a professional author bio. Be ready to engage with visitors, answer questions about your book, and provide signed copies.\nNetwork Effectively", "Networking is a significant part of the book fair experience. Prepare a concise elevator pitch for your book and yourself as an author. Be approachable and open to conversations with fellow authors, publishers, and literary agents. Attend networking events, social gatherings, and panel discussions to expand your connections.\nPromote Your Participation\nBefore the book fair, create a buzz around your participation on social media, your website, and through email newsletters. Let your readers know where and when they can meet you. Encourage your existing fans to spread the word and consider organizing book giveaways or contests to generate excitement.\nPlan Book Signings and Readings\nBook signings and readings are excellent opportunities to engage with readers and create memorable experiences. Schedule these events at your booth or participate in any book fair-sponsored author events. Promote your signings in advance to ensure a good turnout.\nBe Prepared for Follow-Ups", "After the book fair concludes, be prepared to follow up with the connections you\u2019ve made.

A book fair offers a unique way to see a whole literary marketplace interacting in a single location.", "snippets": ["So, for a humble author, a first visit to one of these protean, multi-faceted events can be a daunting and bewildering experience. On top of often being located in a vast, complex area to navigate, such as an exhibition centre, book fairs tend to bombard you with multiple claims on your attention across a range of interlinked venues: author events, company stands, trade talks, demonstrations, and merchandise stands to name a few.\nAt first glance, it can feel like the author is almost irrelevant to the whole scene. Much of what goes on relates to the backend of the publishing business, which the author has little to do with on a daily basis. But in recent years, we have seen a definite move towards making book fairs much more author-friendly. Here are some pointers to help you make the most of the event!\nPrepare for Your Visit", "Fairs put on a range of really interesting talks by authors who will share their journeys to publication, whether through a traditional model or one of the new, highly successful independent routes, such as self-publishing. Industry trends, new Amazon author features, changes in rights legislation, the rise of audio and alternative storytelling platforms: if it\u2019s relevant to publishing now and in the future, and it\u2019s of interest to you, it\u2019ll be discussed at one of the many book fairs out there, and you should grab the opportunity to absorb all the info you can.\nDon\u2019t Be Shy", "With popular events, it\u2019s a good idea to book ahead. If there\u2019s a subject or a writer you\u2019re dead set on hearing about, chances are you\u2019re not the only one. The fair website will advise you of events that are likely to get booked out, too.\nThink About Your Own Promotion\nBook fairs take a dim view of authors who try to hand out flyers about their latest thrillers, and not just because the show\u2019s official exhibitors will have paid a premium for the same privilege. But you can certainly bring some samples and have a business card with your name, website, and contact information handy to give out to useful new colleagues.", "If you just turn up at the event and start wandering around, taking it all in, you\u2019ll quickly be defeated by everything that\u2019s being offered. Instead of diving in headfirst, take a good look at the fair\u2019s website beforehand, and study the program of events and list of exhibitors to help map out your route before arrival.\nAre there particular publishers you\u2019d like to take a look at? Seminars on useful topics you\u2019d like to catch? Authors you\u2019d like to hear speak? Make a note of where these key things are in relation to each other, and when, so you can make the most effective use of your time there. You can also download a Book Fair app, which will help you get familiar with the layout and prompt you about events and timings, too.\nFinally, wear comfortable, casual, yet smart clothes and shoes that are good for walking. You\u2019ll be doing a lot of it!\nBook Ahead for Things You Don\u2019t Want to Miss", "Additionally, shows like the London Book Fair (LBF) now runs a dedicated author club, which offers a newsletter, author discounts, and the opportunity to get your book in front of publishers and agents. The LBF has also recently introduced an event called The Write Stuff, a sort of Dragon\u2019s Den for authors where they get to pitch their books to a panel of publishing professionals in front of a live audience. The prize is a meeting with an agent!\nSee the Fair as a Chance to Learn\nThough for individual authors there are some opportunities to promote your work, much of the hustle that goes on at a book fair is on a business-to-business, or trade level. It\u2019s probably more helpful to see the event as a learning opportunity rather than a marketing exercise.", "Some of the most valuable experiences at book fairs can come from one-on-one encounters and new acquaintances that you make, sometimes entirely by chance. Make a point of introducing yourself to editors, publishers and agents if you can. Think about what you want to say beforehand so the other person gets a quick, crisp understanding of who you are and what you\u2019re about. Don\u2019t expect to be able to develop a long conversation at the stand, though \u2013 this is where sellers of rights interact with other publishers, who are keen to meet as many people as possible. But if you can strike a chord with someone, you\u2019ll at least have established a contact that you can follow up on later. Often at book fairs you can book a meeting with an agent, and the networking drinks that usually take place after the show has closed for the day offer a more informal chance to rub shoulders with publishing professionals.\nEnjoy Your World!", "Wherever you are on your publishing journey, don\u2019t forget to take a moment to relish this whole event, of which you are a deserved part. Book fairs don\u2019t have to be all work. Enjoy the parade, and browse the new and unexpected. If you\u2019re able to attend with another author or a publishing friend, you\u2019ll enjoy the experience even more.\nFollow Up Promptly\nAfter the fair, make a point of following up with any useful contacts you made at the show. It\u2019s always best to do this within a few days of the event, while memories are still fresh, and don\u2019t forget to include enough detail for your contact to remember you.

The early winter fair includes books for younger kids, which students can wrap as gifts for family members.", "snippets": ["With a focus on student equity and revenue scenarios, these librarians put their own stamp on book fairs.\nI\u2019ve always had a love-hate relationship with book fairs. Well, probably more of a like-hate relationship. I inherited an October Scholastic book fair my first year as a school librarian and assumed it was part of the job. Even with tips from the previous librarian and help from volunteers, I was overwhelmed. I could never reconcile the registers with the daily receipts. But most of all, I hated that some kids couldn\u2019t afford books.\nThe day before the fair, each class came to preview items and make wish lists to bring home. I felt conflicted, imagining students begging their parents for books. I told classes that maybe their parents would say yes, but they might say no, and that was OK. I said I planned to buy many of the books for our library, so they should give me their recommendations.", "Love My Library These online book fairs from Read-a-Thon are similar to Boosterthon fundraisers where families are encouraged to register and pledge money. Each student who registers gets a participation prize even if they don\u2019t raise funds. Fifty percent of donations go to students to buy books or other items and 50 percent to the library. Profits can be taken as a Follett Titlewave gift card for books, 75 cents on the dollar in cash, or a combination of each. All orders get sent to the school.", "We put a sticker inside each book that said, \u201cThis book is a gift from North Springfield Elementary School to:_______________.\u201d After students chose their books, they wrote their names on the stickers. This prevented book mix-ups and let parents know where the books came from. Before the fair, we also had a student bookmark design contest and chose three winners from 87 entries. We printed 200 of each winning design and each student chose one to keep.\nHands down, this was the best book fair I\u2019ve had. Student excitement was high! Several kids chose one book for themselves and one for a sibling. Although it was almost as tiring as a traditional fair, it wasn\u2019t as stressful, because I didn\u2019t have to deal with money. My main concern was collecting new books and thinking of ways to improve next year\u2019s True Book FAIR.", "The library should promote free, open, and equitable access to books for all students.

I had a plan to give out golden tickets to students who didn\u2019t bring money and forgot about wish lists.\nHaving students make lists of coveted items, knowing some families can\u2019t afford it, is kind of cruel, when you think about it. Each year I tried to make the experience more equitable, using profits to ensure all students chose a book. But kids are smart. No matter how I tried to dress it up, many still considered it charity. At my school, 46 percent of students receive free/reduced lunch benefits. That means nearly half of our families might not have disposable income to spend at a book fair. When I considered the pros and cons of fairs, I concluded the benefits would never outweigh the inequity issue.", "Novel Nation fairs Melissa Corey, 2023 School Librarian of the Year finalist, also hosts free book fairs at Robidoux Middle School in St. Joseph, MO. She has two \u201cNovel Nation Book Fairs\u201d each year, relying on Title 1 funds and grants to purchase enough books so each student can choose three. Although Corey agrees that \u201ctraditional book fairs can be huge fundraising opportunities for libraries in need,\u201d she advises school librarians to \u201censure that literacy is a right and not a privilege.\u201d Her advice: \u201cStart small, seek out funding, and represent diverse voices.\u201d\nOnline, in-store, & more\nIf you must host a fair to raise funds, consider a virtual, in-store, or weekend one. Purchases are private, which many parents appreciate. The virtual and in-store versions are a lot less work for you, and all three options don\u2019t disrupt normal library services.", "True Book FAIR I was inspired by Julie Stivers, 2023 School Librarian of the Year, to host a free book fair this year.

The online version lets the school select books, and purchases are shipped to students\u2019 homes. The school gets 15 percent of profits in cash or 25 percent in books with a combination option. A book drive feature allows local businesses and the community to donate money to ensure all students can choose books. Bookworm Central also offers an online bookstore option that generates profits for the school throughout the year.", "Librarians without a guaranteed annual budget see fairs as necessary fundraisers. I\u2019m lucky to have a guaranteed annual budget so I don\u2019t have to seek outside funding. If every school library had that, would we host fewer traditional fairs? Maybe, but even those with reliable budgets look to fairs for discretionary funds. This amount depends on book-fair revenue. My Scholastic events always sold over $10,000, and I took the profits in Scholastic dollars and cash. Book fair revenue from other schools in my district range from $2,500\u2013$50,000.\nPatty Lambusta, a middle school librarian in Virginia, considers book fairs \u201ca necessary evil\u201d to purchase items not covered by the school. But what if there were other ways to generate library funds, spark excitement about books, and let students add to their home libraries, all with less effort and more equity? Would you try them? Here are some options.", "I\u2019m not the only educator to think so. Many librarians have pointed out that book fairs contradict what most school libraries hold fundamental\u2014free and open access to books. So why do we still have them? I surveyed 393 school librarians on the topic, using an anonymous Google form, asking what they like and dislike about book fairs. Most respondents still like them, with 63 percent having two to three fairs each year. Here\u2019s what else librarians have to say.\nExcitement. Asked what they like best about fairs, 196 respondents included the word \u201cexcitement\u201d (among staff, students, and families) in their answers. Makes sense\u2014promoting a love of books is a mainstay of the profession.", "Barnes & Noble (in-store and virtual): You schedule a date with your local store and it provides vouchers to distribute. Vouchers must be presented at the store, so purchases are credited to the school\u2019s account. Purchases can also be made online using an event ID number. Profits can be taken as a check or Barnes & Noble gift card. Percentages vary depending on total sales, with a gift card option providing a higher amount. For sales up to $1,500, schools receive five percent, and a gift card is the only option. Sales above $10,000 yield 10 percent by check or 15 percent as a store gift card.\nWeekend events Moving fairs to after-school and weekend hours give students who can\u2019t participate the ability to opt out. Carolyn Vibbert, librarian at Sudley Elementary School in Manassas, VA, experimented with a weekend fair in 2021, held Friday evening through Sunday afternoon. Her profits were close to those of fairs held during school hours. A main benefit: more family participation.", "Profits. Many listed profits as a top benefit. Eighty-seven percent decide how funds are used, including to buy books for the library, author visits, makerspace supplies, and other library-related items or programs. For school librarians with no guaranteed budget, book fairs are often the only way to add new books to their collections.\nHome libraries. Students, especially those who don\u2019t visit bookstores, can purchase books to keep forever and share with their families.\nLife experience. Some liked giving students the chance to shop and make decisions. I did too. Children have few opportunities to shop on their own and handle money. The fair is a safe environment for them to practice estimating, rounding, and prioritizing.\nInequity. For me, this is the biggest drawback. But only 30 percent of respondents agreed with the statement, \u201cI think book fairs aren\u2019t equitable.\u201d", "Exhaustion. Exhaustion and resentment at having to run a fair on top of other duties were frequently cited issues. Fifty-seven percent agreed: \u201cI feel exhausted just thinking about the book fair.\u201d Running one, even with volunteers, is a full-time job.\nLogistical frustration. Respondents cited issues with Scholastic regarding selection (including limited diverse titles), high prices, low-quality books, non-book \u201cjunk\u201d items, and logistical support. But 78 percent still have Scholastic fairs.", "I followed her lead and set a target of two free books per student. My elementary school has about 500 students in pre-K\u20135, so my goal was 1,200 books. This would ensure each student could choose two, from a decent selection. I met with my principal and PTA officers in September to begin planning our May True Book FAIR. Although I know which books are checked out most, I created a Google student survey to help generate a shopping list. Then I began writing grants. Most books came from seven DonorsChoose grants, totaling over $6,000. I also received a grant from Lisa Libraries for 200 books, a PTA grant, and books from a PTA-sponsored Amazon wish list.\nMany parents and their families made generous donations. I surpassed my initial 1,200 book goal, gathering 1,385. The fair ran the week of Memorial Day with students choosing books during their regular library time.

I spend most of my professional life chained to my office chair, hammering away at the keyboard, so when there's a book fair or I'm invited for a signing or some such thing, I tend not to stop and wonder if it's really worth my time.

That's still not looking that great.\nOkay. So book fairs are, financially speaking, not that awesome of a time investment. At least not for me. I could have made a lot more money staying at home and working on the next powder mage novella. The only thing I can do is file that financial report away in my brain next to all my other experiences and impressions from the book fair and look at them all in one big lump to decide whether it was actually worth my time.\nOverall, I sold to new fans and connected with current ones and deepened my impression on the reading community, which can't really be quantified.", "- I had one guy come up who bought Promise of Blood as a gift for his son when he attended last year.

Several had hooked at least one other person on the series.\nWhat I'm getting from all this is that these book fairs, beyond the cold sale of eighteen copies, have a ripple effect that is utterly impossible to predict.

Forgetting the positive or negative emotional impact, I wanted to take a look at whether this was actually paying for itself for me, the author.\nFirst, a couple thoughts.\n- I don't think Adult SFF is a best-selling genre at these book fairs. I've noticed that the big sellers tend to be inspirational, local non-fiction, mystery, and sports. Even better if the books hit more than one category. YA also sells fantastic, but that's it's own beast.

Fourteen of those were Promise of Blood in trade paperback and four of those were Crimson Campaign in hardcover. I make 7.5% of the cover price of trade paperbacks and 10% for hardcovers.

The transfer provides that your mother will have the right to all income and full use of the property for her life. Even though your mother dies 1 week after the transfer, the value of the property on the date it is given is its present value, subject to the life interest as estimated from actuarial tables. You may not take a higher deduction because the charity received full use and possession of the land only 1 week after the transfer. Using Past Events To Predict the Future A common error is to rely too much on past events that do not fairly reflect the probable future earnings and FMV. Example. You give all your rights in a successful patent to your favorite charity. Your records show that before the valuation date there were three stages in the patent's history of earnings. First, there was rapid growth in earnings when the invention was introduced. Then, there was a period of high earnings when the invention was being exploited", ". Under the option, the university could buy the property at any time during a 2-year period for $40,000. The FMV of the property on the date the option is granted is $50,000. In the following tax year, the university exercises the option. The FMV of the property on the date the option is exercised is $55,000. Therefore, you have made a charitable contribution of $15,000 ($55,000, the FMV, minus $40,000, the exercise price) in the tax year the option is exercised. Determining FMV Determining the value of donated property depends upon many factors. You should consider all the facts and circumstances connected with the property, including any recent transactions, in determining value.

The interest rate to use is under the heading \u201cRate Under Section 7520\u201d for a given month and year. For a transfer involving a charitable interest, you may elect to use the interest rate for the month of the donation or the interest rate for either of the 2 preceding months. You must use the same interest rate to determine the present value of all interests in that property. You must attach a statement to the return to take the election. You can call the IRS office at 800-829-1040 to obtain this rate. Actuarial tables", ". Employers can register to use Business Services Online.

Stocks or bonds listed on more than one stock exchange are valued based on the prices of the exchange on which they are principally dealt. This applies if these prices are published in a generally available listing or publication of general circulation. If this is not applicable, and the stocks or bonds are reported on a composite listing of combined exchanges in a publication of general circulation, use the composite list. See also Unavailable prices, later. Bid and asked prices on valuation date. If there were no sales within a reasonable period before and after the valuation date, the FMV is the average price between the bona fide bid and asked prices on the valuation date. Example. Although there were no sales of Blue Corporation stock on the valuation date, bona fide bid and asked prices were available on that date of $14 and $16, respectively. The FMV is $15, the average price between the bid and asked prices. No prices on valuation date", ".

Your deduction for a donated car, boat, or airplane is generally limited to the gross proceeds from its sale by the qualified organization. This rule applies if the claimed value of the donated vehicle is more than $500. In certain cases, you can deduct the vehicle's FMV. For details, see Pub. 526. Inventory If you donate any inventory item to a charitable organization, the amount of your deductible contribution is generally the FMV of the item, minus any gain you would have realized if you had sold the item at its FMV on the date of the gift. For more information, see Pub. 526.

The FMV of assets of the business including goodwill, if applicable. The value of interests in businesses engaged in the same or similar industries. You should keep complete financial and other information on which the valuation is based. This includes copies of reports of examinations of the business made by accountants, engineers, or any technical experts on or close to the valuation date. Annuities, Interests for Life or Terms of Years, Remainders, and Reversions The FMV of these kinds of property is their present value, except in the case of annuities under contracts issued by companies regularly engaged in their sale. The valuation of these commercial annuity contracts and of insurance policies is discussed later under Certain Life Insurance and Annuity Contracts", ". The price that buyers of used items actually pay in used clothing stores, such as consignment or thrift shops, is an indication of the value. You cannot take an income tax charitable contribution deduction for an item of clothing unless it is in good used condition or better. An item of clothing that is not in good used condition or better for which you claim an income tax charitable contribution deduction of more than $500 requires a qualified appraisal and a completed Form 8283. See Deduction over $500 for certain clothing or household items, later.

An arm's-length offer to buy the property close to the valuation date may help to prove its value if the person making the offer was willing and able to complete the transaction. To rely on an offer, you should be able to show proof of the offer and the specific amount to be paid. Offers to buy property other than the donated item will help to determine value if the other property is reasonably similar to the donated property. Sales of Comparable Properties The sales prices of properties similar to the donated property are often important in determining the FMV. The weight to be given to each sale depends on the following. The degree of similarity between the property sold and the donated property. The time of the sale\u2014whether it was close to the valuation date. The circumstances of the sale\u2014whether it was at arm's-length with a knowledgeable buyer and seller, with neither having to act. The conditions of the market in which the sale was made\u2014whether unusually inflated or deflated", ". In addition, an individual is not a qualified appraiser for a particular donation if the donor had knowledge of facts that would cause a reasonable person to expect the appraiser to falsely overstate the value of the donated property. For example, if the donor and the appraiser make an agreement concerning the amount at which the property will be valued, and the donor knows that amount is more than the FMV of the property, the appraiser is not a qualified appraiser for the donation. Appraiser penalties. An appraiser who prepares an incorrect appraisal may have to pay a penalty if the appraiser knows, or reasonably should have known, the appraisal would be used in connection with a return or claim for refund, and the appraisal resulted in: A substantial valuation misstatement, A substantial estate or gift valuation understatement, or A gross valuation misstatement", ".

The one exception to this is a household item that is not in good used condition or better for which you claim an income tax charitable contribution deduction of more than $500. In this case, you must obtain a qualified appraisal valuing the item and complete a Form 8283. See Deduction over $500 for certain clothing or household items, later.

FMV. FMV is the price that property would sell for on the open market. It is the price that would be agreed on between a willing buyer and a willing seller, with neither being required to act, and both having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts. In addition to this general rule, there are special rules used to value certain types of property such as remainder interests, annuities, interests for life or for a term of years, and reversions, discussed below. Example 1. If you give an item of used clothing that is in good used condition or better to the Salvation Army, the FMV would be the price that typical buyers actually pay for clothing of this age, condition, style, and use. Usually, such items are worth far less than what you paid for them. Example 2", ".

You determine the FMV of the real property absent the qualified mineral interest in the same manner that you determine the FMV of real estate. See Real Estate, earlier", ". For example, there may be a great difference in value between two diaries that were kept by a famous person\u2014one kept during childhood and the other during a later period in their life. The appraiser determines a value in these cases by applying knowledge and judgment to such factors as comparable sales and market conditions. Cars, Boats, and Aircraft If you donate a car, a boat, or an aircraft to a charitable organization, its FMV must be determined. Certain commercial firms and trade organizations publish monthly or seasonal guides for different regions of the country, containing complete dealer sale prices or dealer average prices for recent model years. Prices are reported for each make, model, and year. These guides also provide estimates for adjusting for unusual equipment, unusual mileage, and physical condition. The prices are not \u201cofficial,\u201d and these publications are not considered an appraisal of any specific donated property", ". You should be able to show the relationship between the depreciated replacement cost and the FMV, as well as how you arrived at the \u201cestimated replacement cost new.\u201d Opinions of Professional Appraisers Generally, the weight given to a professional appraiser\u2019s opinion on matters such as the authenticity of a coin or a work of art, or the most profitable and best use of a piece of real estate, depends on the knowledge and competence of the professional appraiser and the thoroughness with which the opinion is supported by experience and facts.

The appraiser, however, may provide a group description for selected items the total value of which is not more than $100. Qualified appraiser. A qualified appraiser is an individual with verifiable education and experience in valuing the type of property for which the appraisal is performed. The individual: Has earned an appraisal designation from a generally recognized professional appraiser organization, for the type of property being valued; or Has met certain minimum education requirements and 2 or more years of experience in valuing the type of property being valued", ". The FMV of the property before the grant of the conservation easement must take into account not only the current use of the property but also an objective assessment of how immediate or remote the likelihood is that the property, without the easement, would be developed. In determining whether the property could be developed, you must also consider any zoning, conservation, or historical preservation laws that would already restrict the property's potential highest and best use. Finally, if a potential highest and best use is being considered that would require a change in zoning or other restrictions on the property, you must address whether it is reasonably probable that such a change would be permitted. Granting a conservation easement may increase, rather than reduce, the value of property, and in such a situation no deduction would be allowed. Example. You own 10 acres of farmland. Similar land in the area has an FMV of $2,000 an acre", ". If your request lacks essential information, you will be notified and given 30 days to provide the missing information.

Because many kinds of art may be the subject of a charitable donation, it is not possible to discuss all of the possible types in this publication. Most common are paintings, sculptures, watercolors, prints, drawings, ceramics, antiques, decorative arts, textiles, carpets, silver, rare manuscripts, and historical memorabilia. Authenticity", ". The promoter claimed that the price was \u201cwholesale\u201d even though this dealer and other dealers made similar sales at similar prices to other persons who were not dealers. The promoter said that if Bailey kept the gems for more than 1 year and then gave them to charity, Bailey could claim a charitable deduction of $15,000, which, according to the promoter, would be the value of the gems at the time of contribution. Bailey gave the gems to a qualified charity 13 months after buying them. The selling price for these gems had not changed from the date of purchase to the date Bailey donated them to charity. The best evidence of FMV depends on actual transactions and not on some artificial estimate. The $5,000 paid by Bailey and others is, therefore, the best evidence of the maximum FMV of the gems. Terms of the purchase or sale. The terms of the purchase or sale should be considered in determining FMV if they influenced the price", ". The FMV of a donated vehicle is the same as the price listed in a used vehicle pricing guide for a private party sale only if the guide lists a sales price for a vehicle that is the same make, model, and year, sold in the same area, in the same condition, with the same or similar options or accessories, and with the same or similar warranties as the donated vehicle. Example. You donate a used car in poor condition to a local high school for use by students studying car repair. A used car guide shows the dealer retail value for this type of car in poor condition is $1,600. However, the guide shows the price for a private party sale of the car is only $750. The FMV of the car is considered to be no more than $750. Boats. Except for inexpensive small boats, the valuation of boats should be based on an appraisal by a marine surveyor because the physical condition is so critical to the value. More information", ". If the individual listing in the National Register of Historic Places consists of a more than one building (for example, a house, a garage, a mill complex, etc.) the Secretary of the Interior may have to certify which of the multiple buildings qualify as certified historic structures. A registered historic district is any district listed in the National Register of Historic Places. A state or local historic district may also qualify as a registered historic district if the district and the enabling statutes are certified by the Secretary of the Interior.

If the deduction is first claimed on an amended return, the qualified appraisal must be received before the date on which the amended return is filed. An appraisal is not a qualified appraisal if you fail to disclose or you misrepresent facts to your appraiser and a reasonable person would expect this failure or misrepresentation to cause the appraiser to misstate the value of the property you contributed. Form 8283 must be completed and attached to your tax return. Generally, you do not need to attach the qualified appraisal itself, but you should keep a copy as long as it may be relevant under the tax law. There are four exceptions. If you claim a deduction of $20,000 or more for donations of art, you should attach a complete copy of the appraisal. See Art and Collectibles, earlier. If you claim a deduction of more than $500,000 for a donation of property, you must attach the appraisal. See Deductions of More Than $500,000, earlier", ". If the comparable sales method is used to determine the value of unimproved real property (land without significant buildings, structures, or any other improvements that add to its value), the appraiser should consider the following factors when comparing the potential comparable property and the donated property. Location, size, and zoning or use restrictions. Accessibility and road frontage, and available utilities and water rights. Riparian rights (right of access to and use of the water by owners of land on the bank of a river) and existing easements, rights-of-way, leases, etc. Soil characteristics, vegetative cover, and status of mineral rights. Other factors affecting value.

Was there an arm's-length offer to buy the property close to the valuation date? sales of comparable properties How similar is the property sold to the property donated? How close is the date of sale to the valuation date? Was the sale at arm's-length? What was the condition of the market at the time of sale? replacement cost What would it cost to replace the donated property? Is there a reasonable relationship between replacement cost and FMV? Is the supply of the donated property more or less than the demand for it? opinions of professional appraisers Is the professional appraiser knowledgeable and competent? Is the opinion thorough and supported by facts and experience? Problems in Determining FMV There are a number of problems in determining the FMV of donated property", ". For example, if the donor acquired a painting from an art dealer, neither the dealer nor persons employed by the dealer can be qualified appraisers for that painting. Any person related under section 267(b) of the Internal Revenue Code to any of the above persons or married to a person related under section 267(b) to any of the above persons.

An individual who is prohibited from practicing before the IRS under section 330(c) of title 31 of the United States Code at any time during the 3\u2010year period ending on the date the appraisal is signed by the individual", ". Because many kinds of collectibles may be the subject of a charitable donation, it is not possible to discuss all of the possible types in this publication. Most common are rare books, autographs, sports memorabilia, dolls, manuscripts, stamps, coins, guns, gems, jewelry, music and entertainment memorabilia, comics, toys, and natural history items. Reference material. Publications available to help you determine the value of many kinds of collections include catalogs, dealers' price lists, and specialized hobby periodicals. When using one of these price guides, you must use the current edition at the date of contribution. . These sources are not always reliable indicators of FMV and should be supported by other evidence.. For example, a dealer may sell an item for much less than is shown on a price list, particularly after the item has remained unsold for a long time. The price an item sold for in an auction may have been the result of a rigged sale or a mere bidding duel", ". Most libraries have catalogs or other books that report the publisher's estimate of values. Generally, two price levels are shown for each stamp: the price postmarked and the price not postmarked. Contact an appraiser for assistance with properly valuing stamp collections. Coin collections. Many catalogs and other reference materials show the writer's or publisher's opinion of the value of coins on or near the date of the publication. Like many other collectors' items, the value of a coin depends on the demand for it, its age, and its rarity. Another important factor is the coin's condition. For example, there is a great difference in the value of a coin that is in mint condition and a similar coin that is only in good condition. Use caution when consulting price guides for coins as only a trained grader can distinguish the difference between various Mint State grades and circulated grades including extremely fine, very fine, fine, very good, good, fair, or poor", ".gov/TCE or download the free IRS2Go app for information on free tax return preparation.

Interest in a Business The FMV of any interest in a closely held business (whether a sole proprietorship or a business taxed as a corporation or partnership) is the amount that a willing buyer would pay for the interest to a willing seller after consideration of all relevant factors. Because of the many factors to be considered in determining the FMV of an interest in a closely held business, the help of experts is usually required. Such a determination requires the consideration of all available financial data, as well as all relevant factors affecting FMV. The following factors, although not all-inclusive, may be helpful. The business's net worth and prospective earning power", ". Modified basis, with respect to any member, is the adjusted basis in the member\u2019s interest in the pass-through entity as determined (I) immediately before the conservation contribution, (II) without regard to the member\u2019s share of any liabilities of the pass-through entity, and (III) by the entity after taking into account the adjustments described in subclauses (I) and (II). The pass-through entity must determine such member's modified basis. More information. For more information about qualified conservation contributions, see Pub. 526. Substantiation of Noncash Charitable Contributions What you need to substantiate your deduction depends upon the property being donated and the claimed value of this property. There are three types of documents that may be required in order to substantiate your contribution. Contemporaneous Written Acknowledgment (CWA). Form 8283. An appraisal, which in some cases must be a \u201cqualified appraisal,\u201d completed by a \u201cqualified appraiser.\u201d CWA", ". Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the promoter gave Quinn Black a second option. The promoter said that if Quinn wanted a charitable deduction within 1 year of the purchase, Quinn could buy the 500 books at the \u201cretail\u201d price of $30,000, paying only $10,000 in cash and giving a promissory note for the remaining $20,000. The principal and interest on the note would not be due for 12 years. According to the promoter, Quinn could then, within 1 year of the purchase, give the books to a qualified organization and claim the full $30,000 retail price as a charitable contribution. Quinn purchased the books under the second option and, 3 months later, gave them to a house of worship, which will use the books for religious purposes. At the time of the gift, the promoter was selling similar lots of books for either $10,000 or $30,000. The difference between the two prices was solely at the discretion of the buyer. The promoter was a willing seller for $10,000", ". If you claim a deduction of more than $10,000 for an easement or other restriction on the exterior of a historically significant building, your deduction will not be allowed unless you pay a $500 filing fee. See Form 8283-V and its instructions. If you claimed the rehabilitation credit for a National Register or historically significant building for any of the 5 years before the year of the qualified conservation contribution, your charitable deduction is reduced. For more information, see Form 3468, Investment Credit, and section 170(f)(14). Qualified real property interest. This is any of the following interests in real property. Your entire interest in real estate other than a mineral interest (subsurface oil, gas, or other minerals, and the right of access to these minerals). A remainder interest", ". A remainder interest in real property. You determine the FMV of a remainder interest in real property as directed earlier under Remainder Interest in Real Property. A conservation restriction (granted in perpetuity) on the use which may be made of real property. The value of the charitable contribution of a perpetual conservation restriction (conservation easement) is the FMV of the easement at the time of the contribution. In determining the FMV of a conservation easement, if there is a substantial record of arm's-length sales of conservation easements on other properties that are the same as or very similar to the donated conservation easement, you must take into account the selling price of these easements. If there are no comparable sales, the FMV of the conservation easement is generally determined indirectly as the difference between the FMVs of the property before and after the grant of the conservation easement", ". Remainder Interest in Real Property The amount of the deduction for a donation of a remainder interest in real property is the FMV of the remainder interest at the time of the contribution, determined as the present value of that remainder interest. To determine the present value of the remainder interest, you must know the FMV of the property as a whole (from which the remainder interest is donated) on the date of the contribution. Multiply the FMV of the whole property by the appropriate remainder factor. Examples in Pubs. 1457, 1458 and 1459 show how to use these factors and contain links to these tables. If the underlying property of which the remainder interest being donated is depreciable property, you must make an adjustment for depreciation or depletion using the factors in Table C, as referenced by and explained in Pub. 1459, Actuarial Valuations, Version 4C. See Annuities, Interests for Life or Terms of Years, Remainders, and Reversions, earlier. You can download Pub", ". The comparable selling prices must be adjusted to account for differences between the sale property and the donated property. Because differences of opinion may arise between appraisers as to the degree of comparability and the amount of the adjustment considered necessary for comparison purposes, an appraiser should document each item of adjustment. Only comparable sales having the least adjustments in terms of items and/or total dollar adjustments should be considered as comparable to the donated property. 2. Capitalization of Income This method capitalizes the net income from the property at a rate that represents a fair return on the particular investment at the particular time, considering the risks involved. The key elements are the determination of the income to be capitalized and the rate of capitalization. 3. Replacement Cost New or Reproduction Cost Minus Observed Depreciation This method, used alone, usually does not result in a determination of FMV", ". Instead, it generally tends to set the upper limit of value, particularly in periods of rising costs, because it is reasonable to assume that an informed buyer will not pay more for the real estate than it would cost to reproduce a similar property. Of course, this reasoning does not apply if a similar property cannot be created because of location, unusual construction, or some other reason. Generally, this method serves to support the value determined from other methods. When the replacement cost method is applied to improved realty, the land and improvements are valued separately. The replacement cost of a building is figured by considering the materials, the quality of workmanship, and the number of square feet or cubic feet in the building. This cost represents the total cost of labor and material, overhead, and profit. After the replacement cost has been figured, consideration must be given to the following factors", ". If you claim a deduction of more than $500 for an article of clothing, or a household item, that is not in good used condition or better, you must attach the appraisal. See Deduction over $500 for certain clothing or household items, earlier. If you claim a deduction for an easement or other restriction on the exterior of a building in a historic district, you must attach the appraisal. See Certified historic structures, earlier. Prohibited appraisal fee. Generally, no part of the fee arrangement for a qualified appraisal can be based on a percentage of the appraised value of the property. If a fee arrangement is based on what is allowed as a deduction, after IRS examination or otherwise, it is treated as a fee based on a percentage of appraised value. Information included in qualified appraisal. A qualified appraisal must include the following information", ". In some instances, the opinions of equally qualified appraisers may carry unequal weight, such as when one appraiser has a better knowledge of local conditions. The appraisal report must contain a complete description of the property, such as street address, legal description, and lot and block number, as well as physical features, condition, and dimensions. The use to which the property is put, zoning and permitted uses, and its potential use for other higher and better uses are also relevant. In general, there are three main approaches to the valuation of real estate. An appraisal may require the combined use of two or three methods rather than one method only. 1. Comparable Sales The comparable sales method compares the donated property with several similar properties that have been sold. The selling prices, after adjustments for differences in date of sale, size, condition, and location, would then indicate the estimated FMV of the donated property", ".gov/WMAR to track the status of Form 1040-X amended returns. .It can take up to 3 weeks from the date you filed your amended return for it to show up in our system, and processing it can take up to 16 weeks..

The phrase \u201csimilar items\u201d means property of the same generic category or type (whether or not donated to the same donee), such as stamps, coins, fine art, books, nonpublicly traded stock, nonpublicly traded securities other than nonpublicly traded stock, land, buildings, clothing, jewelry, furniture, household goods, collectibles, or decorative arts. For example, if you give books to three schools and you deduct $2,000, $2,500, and $900, respectively, your claimed deduction is more than $5,000 for these books. You must get a qualified appraisal of the books and for each school you must attach a fully completed Form 8283, Section B, to your tax return. Publicly traded securities", ". The degree of similarity must be close enough so that this selling price would have been given consideration by reasonably well-informed buyers or sellers of the property. Example. You give a rare, old book to your former college. The book is a third edition and is in poor condition because of a missing back cover. You discover that there was a sale for $300, near the valuation date, of a first edition of the book that was in good condition. Although the contents are the same, the books are not at all similar because of the different editions and their physical condition. Little consideration would be given to the selling price of the $300 property by knowledgeable buyers or sellers. Future Events You may not consider unexpected events happening after your donation of property in making the valuation. You may consider only the facts known at the time of the gift, and those that could reasonably be expected at the time of the gift. Example. You give farmland to a qualified charity", ". Need someone to prepare your tax return?

Here are some ways the Eventee app can help you apply the tips shared in this blog.", "On the day of the event, the event speaker's presentation also needs to be carefully coordinated with the event schedule to ensure a seamless flow. Effective speaker management is critical in ensuring that the event achieves its objectives and leaves a positive impression on attendees.\n\ud83c\udfa4 What are the different types of speakers at conferences\nNow that you understand why guest speakers are important for your event, we\u2019re going to give you a brief rundown of the different types of guest speakers available.\nModerators\nA moderator plays a key role in ensuring the smooth running of any business event. They are responsible for guiding the discussion and keeping the audience engaged. With an experienced moderator, the event will be an informative and engaging experience for all involved.\nKeynote speakers", "Once you\u2019ve sourced a suitable guest speaker, you need to use this to your advantage and get the very most out of having them at your event. Here\u2019s a few things you should consider:\nGet a grip on the tech\nFamiliarising yourself and your guest speaker with any technology that\u2019s being used on the day. Some tech can be used in the lead up to the event itself, so your guest speakers will have time to get to grips with the tech used. This ensures they feel confident with the systems you have in place by the time of the event.\nEncourage engagement\nFacilitate your attendee interaction with guest speakers using a user-friendly event app, like Eventee. This encourages engagement throughout the event. Encouraging your guest speakers to \u2018get on board\u2019 with the app beforehand gives everyone a chance to network and for guest speakers to have a better understanding of who they will be speaking to and their needs.\nCreate event buzz", "We\u2019ve created a comprehensive guide on types of speakers at conferences, how to find speakers for events, how to introduce a guest speaker, and more. Discover best practices on speaker management to maximise your event's success.\n\ud83d\ude80 What does a guest speaker bring to the event\nThe purpose of having a guest speaker is to add value to the event. A guest speaker:\n- provides valuable insights\n- shares knowledge and expertise\n- offers a new perspective on the subject matter\n- dives in deep to the topics and provides your attendees with all the must have information\nThat's why it\u2019s important to carefully select an exceptional guest speaker based on their expertise and relevance to the event's theme.\nOnce you\u2019ve found a suitable guest speaker, the management team then communicates with them to confirm their availability. They negotiate their fees and travel arrangements ahead of the event.", "You will want to ensure that you respond to your guest speaker\u2019s queries in a timely manner. This means that you may want to think about giving them a dedicated phone number or email address so that you can personally ensure that any query they have is dealt with quickly and so that the guest speaker feels \u2018heard\u2019 by the business at all times.\nPayment on time\nNobody likes to be left waiting, particularly when it comes to payment. So, make sure you let them know that their invoice for services rendered is of utmost priority. This also means getting clear with your business's payment terms so that you can pass on the correct information to the guest speaker.\nProfessionalism and respectful behaviour\nThis one is a bit of a no brainer, but let's mention it anyway. Ensure that, when engaging with your guest speaker, you keep the tone of conversation professional and that topics covered are specific to the event goal.\nProvide proper accommodations and transportation", "Managing your event speakers is a fine line between researching an event speaker that is going to enliven your event and resonate with potential attendees, as well as organising them beforehand and on the day with effective communication that can be helped by the use of ingenuitive tech such as Eventee.\nWe hope that the tips we\u2019ve shared are helpful to you as you begin to source your next guest speaker.

Someone who, after your event is over, will remember you and your brand and likely share tales of their experience forward to other companies. This is why it\u2019s important to create a smooth process that is positive, respectful and mutually beneficial for both parties involved.\nHere are a few basic etiquette tips to help you successfully manage your guest speakers:\nClear communication and guidance\nTransparency is key when working alongside any business associate. Keep your guest speakers involved with any updates or changes as they happen. Consider sending through their speaker information in a pack that covers all the information they need to know about the business and the event that can serve as point of reference to them at every stage of the event.\nPrompt response", "You can reach out to professional associations and speaker bureaus. They typically specialize in connecting events with professional speakers, making it easier for you to find your ideal guest speaker.\nPrevious event speakers\nYou can check out the list of guest speakers of similar past events for potential candidates. Or explore your competition and their speakers for inspiration.\nOnline platforms\nUtilize platforms like LinkedIn, SpeakerHub, and TED to find professionals who have experience speaking at events. You can even ask your colleagues, industry peers, or other event organizers for recommendations.\nHere are some additional example resources for finding a guest speaker:\n- American Marketing Association (AMA)\n- Project Management Institute (PMI)\n- Washington Speakers Bureau\n- BigSpeak\n- Leading Authorities\nAnd many more\u2026\nThird step: Evaluation", "Marketing your guest speakers ahead of your event is important for overall event success rate.

Your audience must know why they should listen to this person.\n- A great way to start is by creating a hook which grabs the audience's attention and builds anticipation. Start with an interesting fact, an anecdote or relevant quote.\n- If you have a personal story or connection with the guest speaker, share it.

Seriously, it is SOP in almost every industry that exhibitors have flyers to hand out to attendees. This is one of the better ways to get an attendee more info so they can decide whether to follow up later.\nAuthors can adapt this practice by having 4\u201d by 6\u201d flyers printed either at a local print shop or online.

From the good folks at Authors Publish", "Here\u2019s something I had to learn the hard way: If you\u2019re going to talk about your planned activities such as weekly readings at a public library, then it would really help to have a flyer to give out to those who are interested. Some people may remember what you told them about an activity, and others may make a note so they can Google it later, but the way to make sure they don\u2019t forget is to give them a flyer,\n12) Canopy\nThe usual advice on prepping for an event is to do a dry run. Set up your table. Make sure all the signs can stand up on their own, and that your displays do not look cluttered.\nThat is all great advice, but based on what I saw on Saturday I think that when prepping for an event authors should make sure that they also go out in their backyard and set up the canopy they are going to bring to the book fair.", "Your first book fair? Here\u2019s how to prepare!\nNote from Anne: Book fairs are being cancelled all over the world right now. But even pandemics run their course. And as Nate says here, you need to start planning for a fair booth a year ahead of time. I don\u2019t recommend book fairs for new novelists with one or two books. But fairs are great for nonfiction writers or novelists with an established series. (If you follow Nate\u2019s advice!)\nBy Nate Hoffelder\nBook fairs and other local events can be a great way for authors to connect with readers and make new fans. They are immensely valuable. But at the same time it can be hard for first-timers to get the most out of an event.", "You might think that you could simply attend an event as a member of the audience and give it a once-over. But I have found that being a volunteer usually gives me a much better idea how the event is run. It lets me peek behind the scenes, ask questions about the audience, and interrogate chat with exhibitors, guests, and staff.\nIn fact, the process of signing up to be a volunteer could tell you a lot about how well-run an event is.\nWarning signs of a poorly run event:\n- The organizers don\u2019t have a process for signing up volunteers.\n- They bungle your assignment. (I was once sent to staff an information desk without any information to provide to the guests.)\n3) Be Prepared\nWhen I say you should plan your activities, I don\u2019t just mean write out a schedule or make a list of what you need to bring.\nWhat I now do is write what are essentially business process documents that lay out every step of every activity.\n- A doc for networking,\n- Another one for being an exhibitor.", "When I first started going to events, my planning for any given event began and ended with making sure I had spare socks and a water bottle. Once I realized I needed to invest more time in being prepared, I started making out schedules, to do lists, and talking points. But now when I plan for events I am looking at conventions and book fairs I might attend a year to 18 months from now.\nThe reason I plan so far in advance is that the events themselves are often planned one to two years ahead of time. Guest speakers are locked in at least a year ahead of time, and the rental agreement for the location of next year\u2019s convention is often signed before this year\u2019s convention begins. (In fact, I know one organizer with a convention 10 months away who is already scouting locations for the following year\u2019s convention).", "On the other hand, flyers can be rather expensive ($0.20 to $1 each) compared to the price of most indie-published ebooks, so authors should probably run a cost-benefit analysis first to see whether the flyers are worth the investment.\nIn the three years since I started getting flyers printed, I have found that Vistaprint.com had good prices for flyers. But I have also found that bookmarks are much cheaper and a lot more interesting. I get my bookmarks printed at NextDayFlyers.com. They cost about the same as business cards (three to five cents each) if you order them in large quantities.\n11) Flyers, redux", "This is why you should bring hand sanitizer, antibacterial wipes, and possibly even gloves. Don\u2019t forget to wash your hands, and be sure to wipe down any surfaces you touch more than once. (I can\u2019t say that this is necessary, but I do know several people who, when flying, use wet wipes to clean all the exposed metal and plastic on their seat. They say this keeps them from getting sick, and they are probably right.)\n5) Bring a Camera\nThis one is on me.\nI realized about ten minutes after I started talking to authors at my first book fair that I had neglected to bring any way to document my day. I had left my camera at home, and forgot to charge my smartphone that morning.\nDon\u2019t make my mistake; bring your smartphone so you can show your fans what you\u2019re doing.\nWhile I am rather camera-shy myself, I also know that as a fan I follow the activities of my favorite authors. Fans are interested in this kind of personal detail, and you will make them happy when you share it.", "Here are a few of the things I learned the hard way; how about you?

He has been building and running WordPress sites since 2010. He blogs about indie publishing and helps authors connect with readers by customizing websites to suit each author\u2019s voice. You may have heard The Digital Reader mentioned on podcasts such as The Creative Penn, Wordslinger, or Sell More Books Show.\n***\nNate\u2019s latest project solves the problem of building an author website!\nIt\u2019s called Author Website in a Box.\nIt combines a pre-built home page, bookshelf pages, a contact form, and more, in one easy-to-install package.\n(And did I mention it\u2019s free?)\nNew Scam Alert!", "- A doc for doing a presentation.\n- Another for media interviews.\n- I even have several that lay out what I should do if I am suddenly asked to do a presentation.\nPeriodically I update these process docs as I learn more about promoting myself. I make a point of reading them before events so that the details are fresh in my mind.\n4) Stay Sanitary\nPublic events such as book fairs and conventions are a cauldron of disease\u2013and were even before the current pandemic. Each sniffle, cough, or unwashed hand could be a carrier for a bug. These days it might put you in bed for weeks, in quarantine, or even land you in the hospital.", "That was certainly true for me. I didn\u2019t used to go to events very often because I find meeting new people is stressful. But I have had to force myself to leave my comfort zone so that I could build my web design business. I had to go out and meet potential clients face to face for the exact same reason that authors should go meet readers.\nIf you wait for readers to come find you, you\u2019re going to get lost in the crowd. There are hundreds of thousands of authors out there, all of whom are vying for attention.\nThe following post is a mix of mistakes I made at my first trade shows and tips inspired by my time as a volunteer at book festivals and SF cons.\nIf you have tips you would like to share, I would love to read them in the comments.\n1) Plan For Your First Book Fair in Advance\nThis is a piece of advice that keeps changing as I get more experience under my belt.", "In fact, your fans will want to meet you in person.\n6) Have Chocolate\nAfter exhibiting at five events I can confirm what we had all suspected for years: Chocolate is the one sure-fire way to get people to approach your booth. (This is true for all book-signing events, in my experience\u2013Anne \ud83d\ude42 )\nIf you spend ten dollars to buy a large mixed bag of chocolate, you will make dozens of new acquaintances. (You will also have something on hand to keep your blood sugar up). Just make sure that you put the chocolate in an attractive bowl, and periodically refresh it throughout the day.\nBTW, if you forget to bring chocolate, and your event is located in a hotel, check to see if there are any mints or other candies set out for attendees. You can put those in a bowl on your table, and achieve almost the same effect as chocolate.\n7) Put up Signs", "You are only one person, and you can only carry on one conversation at a time. (Even if you have several people staffing your table, similar limitations apply.) One way to make up for this limitation is to have several inviting signs ranging from a banner hanging behind your table to smaller 8.5 x 11 signs sitting on your table.\nJust remember, these are signs, not hand outs, so be sure to keep the content simple. I limit each sign to just one headline for a single topic, and I phrase the headline like a directive: \u201cSign up for my mailing list\u201d, for example, or \u201cEnter a raffle for a free X!\u201d, or \u201cAsk me about my free service Y\u201d.\nThere are many options, and 8.5 x 11 signs can be printed at home. So there\u2019s no reason not to try several ideas until you find the ones that work the best.\n8) Share your Schedule", "Beware a new scam book publicity company called \u201cAuthor Capital.\u201d This week I heard from mega-selling author Catherine Ryan Hyde, who had been approached by somebody from Author Capital who tried to sell her a bogus book promotion package. They were so clueless they didn\u2019t even know she\u2019s a superstar author who\u2019s sold over 3 million books just since she\u2019s been with her current publisher, Lake Union.\nThese people called her at 7:00 AM (!) to tell her she wasn\u2019t selling well enough, but they could help her career if she just gave them a bunch of money to show her book at book fairs. (Book fair scams are very big with vanity publisher Author Solutions and all their progeny. So if you do go to a book fair, make sure you\u2019re not over-paying.)

In the weeks leading up to your first event, be sure to announce both on social media and via your newsletter that you are going to be at a book fair, show, etc.\nYou might even want to set up an event schedule on your author site so your fans can plan ahead and make sure they have room in their schedules.\n9) Mailing List\nAll the authors I have met at cons and book fair brought books to sell, and they all came prepared to talk about their books, careers, and other topics, but do you know what I would have done?\nI would have found a way to continue the conversation after the event. To wit, I would have brought a tablet so I could let attendees sign up for my mailing list. (Coincidentally, this is something I only thought of after my first trade show.)", "The standard collapsible canopy is really easy to set up once you know how. All it takes is watching one YouTube video and setting it up one time in your backyard. You\u2019ll learn details like there are four specific spots where Velcro on the canopy\u2019s cloth attaches to Velcro on the metal frame (attach the Velcro and the cloth will be lined up correctly). Also, you can tell the frame is properly assembled when the bracing \u201cclicks\u201d into place.\nI helped set up a couple dozen canopies on Saturday, and I can tell you that a little bit of prep time can mean the difference between getting the canopy set up in 90 seconds and struggling with it for half an hour (my first one took me half an hour to set up, yes).\nAs a rule, you should put a similar amount of time into setting up your displays in advance, but in my experience the canopy was the one thing that authors needed help with the most.\n13) Swag", "Furthermore, tables at book fairs and cons can sell out as much as six to nine months before the big day. The window for getting a speaker or panelist invite usually closes three to six months before the opening ceremonies.\nSo if you want to be an active participant at an event, you need start your preparations far in advance.\n2) Volunteer\nOne potential downside to having to plan a year in advance is that you might have to pay for a table before you know whether your investment could pay off. (Or worse yet, you might have to put a non-refundable deposit on a hotel room!)\nIt would be a good idea to scout an event before pulling out your wallet.\nHow? I have found that the best way is to sign up to be a volunteer.", "Sure, bring books to sell, but don\u2019t stop there. An attendee might not want to buy your books (some of us prefer ebooks) but they might be interested in buying merchandise related to your books.\nRemember, one of your goals is to break even or turn a profit from today\u2019s sales. So offer posters, collectibles, bookmarks, or something else that might interest an attendee. If it\u2019s related to your books, you should consider selling it at your table.\nAnd even if you don\u2019t want to sell bookmarks and other swag, you should still bring them if only to give them away. You are going to an event to find readers, but readers are going to find authors. If one takes your bookmark home then chances are the reader will check you out to see if you write books they might like.\nWhat About EBooks?\nI for one would really like to buy ebooks from the authors I meet at cons.

These activities will help to attract more visitors by adding an extra attraction to your event.\nIn addition to the book fair, you can consider setting up other stalls, such as food stalls, gift stalls or zones where you can organise workshops or activities. This will create an exciting atmosphere at your book fair and encourage more people to attend.\n6. Hiring the staff you need\nRegarding trade fair preparation, it is crucial to have sufficient staff on site before, during and after the trade fair to welcome, prepare, collect, answer visitors\u2019 questions, etc. Also, consider implementing a cashless payment system so visitors can quickly and easily buy the books they like or even pay for drinks during their visit.\n7.

Search for sponsors\nTo help you finance your book fair, it is essential that you find a sponsor.\nCollaborate with publishers, writers, and retailers (Waterstones, independent bookshops\u2026) to stay consistent and on topic.

In an age of digital dominance, book fairs may seem like a relic of the past, but they remain an essential element of an author\u2019s journey. In this article, we will explore why authors should get involved in book fairs and how to make the most of this unique platform.\nWhy Authors Should Get Involved in Book Fairs\nExposure and Visibility", "One of the primary reasons authors should participate in book fairs is the exposure and visibility it offers. These events draw a diverse crowd of literary enthusiasts; including publishers, agents, fellow authors, and avid readers. By presenting your work at a book fair, you can increase your book\u2019s visibility and attract potential readers who might not have discovered your work otherwise. It\u2019s a chance to stand out in a crowded marketplace and make a lasting impression.\nNetworking Opportunities\nBook fairs bring together key players in the publishing industry. Authors can network with literary agents, publishers, editors, and fellow authors, creating invaluable connections that may lead to future collaborations, book deals, or endorsements. Building relationships with people who share your passion for literature can open doors to exciting opportunities and help advance your career as an author.\nDirect Reader Engagement", "Book fairs provide a unique platform for direct engagement with your readers. You can interact with your existing fanbase, sign books, and engage in meaningful conversations with readers who are genuinely interested in your work. These personal connections can foster loyalty and turn casual readers into dedicated fans who eagerly anticipate your future releases.\nLearning and Inspiration\nAttending book fairs can be a tremendous learning experience. You can attend seminars, workshops, and panel discussions featuring renowned authors, literary experts, and industry professionals. These sessions offer insights into writing, marketing, and the evolving landscape of publishing. By staying informed and inspired, you can improve your craft and stay ahead in the competitive world of literature.\nHow Authors Can Get Involved in Book Fairs\nChoose the Right Book Fair", "Selecting the right book fair is crucial. Research various book fairs to find the one that aligns with your genre, target audience, and goals. Some well-known book fairs include the Frankfurt Book Fair, BookExpo America, London Book Fair, and local or regional book fairs. Consider your budget, location, and the scale of the event when making your decision.\nPrepare Your Presentation\nOnce you\u2019ve chosen a book fair, it\u2019s time to prepare your presentation. Ensure that your booth or display is visually appealing and reflects the essence of your work. Create eye-catching banners, promotional materials, and a professional author bio. Be ready to engage with visitors, answer questions about your book, and provide signed copies.\nNetwork Effectively", "Networking is a significant part of the book fair experience. Prepare a concise elevator pitch for your book and yourself as an author. Be approachable and open to conversations with fellow authors, publishers, and literary agents. Attend networking events, social gatherings, and panel discussions to expand your connections.\nPromote Your Participation\nBefore the book fair, create a buzz around your participation on social media, your website, and through email newsletters. Let your readers know where and when they can meet you. Encourage your existing fans to spread the word and consider organizing book giveaways or contests to generate excitement.\nPlan Book Signings and Readings\nBook signings and readings are excellent opportunities to engage with readers and create memorable experiences. Schedule these events at your booth or participate in any book fair-sponsored author events. Promote your signings in advance to ensure a good turnout.\nBe Prepared for Follow-Ups", "After the book fair concludes, be prepared to follow up with the connections you\u2019ve made. Send thank-you notes to those you\u2019ve met and continue to nurture your relationships with publishers, agents, and fellow authors. Keep the momentum going by staying in touch and exploring potential collaborations.\nParticipating in book fairs is a strategic move for authors looking to advance their careers and promote their work.

Does it deepen understanding? Does it create an emotional connection? If the answer is no, it might be time to reconsider its inclusion.\nThe Future of Experiential Technology\nAs we look to the future, the potential of experiential technology seems boundless. We're moving towards more personalized, adaptive experiences that can change in real-time based on user behavior and preferences. With the advent of 5G technology, we'll see a more seamless integration of digital elements into our physical world.\nBut no matter how advanced the technology becomes, its purpose will remain the same: to tell stories, create connections, and provide experiences that couldn't be delivered any other way. That's the true power of experiential technology \u2013 not just to wow us with flashy effects, but to touch our hearts and minds in ways we never thought possible.", "So the next time you encounter an immersive experience \u2013 whether it's a breathtaking museum exhibit, an engaging retail display, or a captivating brand activation \u2013 take a moment to look beyond the surface.

For instance, the Bologna Children\u2019s Book Fair held digital exhibitions, webinars, conferences, and virtual rights sales, while the Seoul Book Fair is working on a new virtual platform for a \"mixed reality event\" [2].\n\nMoreover, the development of creative industries, including the publishing sector, has been recognized by governments as a key driver of economic growth and cultural identity. In Kazakhstan, for example, cultural development is a priority, as indicated by specific policies aimed at promoting cultural potential and wealth [3].\n\nAttending international book fairs offers individuals the opportunity to discover new titles, engage with authors, and participate in book-related events.

Ask almost any publisher who regularly attends fairs, and they are likely to have a story about how a chance meeting on a bus, in a bar, or in a bathroom led to their discovering a great book. This gamble that serendipity will pay off is perhaps what drives people to return to fairs time and time again: the chance of stumbling on the next global megaselling book and making it your own.", "Fast forward to 2022. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is likely to cause ripples on the international book fair scene as well, though the full impact is uncertain at press time. For starters, nearly all the major international book fairs announced they have banned Russia\u2019s state-sponsored publishers and booksellers from exhibiting at their fairs, though independent publishers will be allowed. The primary concern is that the war will spill over into other countries in Europe and create hesitation among fairgoers about traveling to the fairs or exhibiting; this would have significant consequences for both Bologna and London. Both fairs have been idle for two years due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and each had offered virtual alternatives in both 2020 and 2021. Most people found these virtual events less than satisfying, however, and it is urgent that the fairs return to in-person events as soon as possible, lest fairgoers lose their sense of loyalty.", "The popularity and importance of any given book fair ebbs and flows over time and is often subject to the politics and economics of a given country. The Buenos Aires Book Fair, for example, is the second largest in the Spanish-language world, but a crash in the value of the peso has meant Argentine publishers have been less able to buy rights or export books. Consequently, the Bogot\u00e1 Book Fair has risen to more prominence in recent years as a result of a more stable Colombian government. In another example, the S\u00e3o Paolo book fair was actively wooing international business in the decade preceding the election of Jair Bolsonaro to the presidency of Brazil, but that largely stopped after the conservative politician took power. The book fair in Moscow began wooing foreign journalists again in 2016, though that is unlikely to resume anytime soon", "Frankfurt, Beijing, and Guadalajara also went digital in 2020, and then each returned with scaled-down in-person events in 2021. Having benefited from its late date in the year, Sharjah was able to hold a modest book fair at the end of 2020, then returned in 2021 with its full show. Thus, Sharjah could take bragging rights to being the biggest book fair in the world last year, attracting 1.3 million people, compared with just 75,000 in 2021 for Frankfurt, which would typically bring in some 300,000, and Guadalajara, which allowed in just 200,000 people, when it would usually host more than 700,000. The Beijing fair was said to be half its usual size in 2021, which generally brings in 300,000 people. All these fairs are not exclusive to publishing professionals and cater to some extent to consumers and members of the public, who account for most of the attendees", "Still, attending an international book fair is a rite of passage for a young person in publishing and a step to career advancement. A trip to Beijing or Bologna, Frankfurt or Guadalajara, London or Sharjah says, \u201cHey, look, I am someone\u201d\u2014someone of status, ambition, vision, or someone with some really good books to sell.\nSo what does the international book fair of the future look like? It may, indeed, be a mixture of physical, in-person events and the continuation of virtual experiences we have seen burgeoning over the past two years. The 2010s saw the launch of at least two new platforms meant to facilitate digital rights trading activity, including PubMatch (partially owned by PW), which works with Bologna, among other fairs, and Frankfurt Rights, which is administered by the Frankfurt Book Fair. Neither platform has supplanted face-to-face meetings, nor were they meant to. Relationship building, however enacted, remains the bedrock of the international publishing industry.", "These large numbers of people spend a lot of money and, accordingly, represent a huge, predictable influx of cash into the community hosting a book fair. Some people take advantage of this, such as the hoteliers in Frankfurt who triple their rates during the fair. When Covid-19 shut down the fairs, national governments were compelled to step in and shore up the finances of the organizers to ensure the fair would keep going. Still, Covid did have some consequences: Jacks Thomas, director of the London Book Fair for seven years, retired, then started working with Bologna, while Frankfurt closed several overseas offices and significantly reduced its overall staff numbers.", "The international circuit begins each year with two spring fairs: the Bologna Children\u2019s Book Fair and the London Book Fair, typically held in March and April, respectively. The several book fairs of the summer and fall follow: Beijing International Book Fair and Frankfurt Book Fair held, respectively, in August or September and October. The fairs rounding out the year include those in Guadalajara, Mexico, and Sharjah, UAE. A slew of other fairs are also of some international, but primarily regional, importance, including those in Abu Dhabi, Brussels, Buenos Aires, Bogot\u00e1, Cairo, Gothenburg, Istanbul, Jerusalem, Kyiv, Leipzig, Montreal, Moscow, New Delhi, Paris, Prague, S\u00e3o Paulo, Seoul, Taipei, and Thessaloniki.

China, too, has used this platform and was the guest of honor at Frankfurt in 2009 and then London in 2012, but encountered aggressive protests, particularly from groups supporting Uyghurs; it has largely abandoned large-scale participation in global fairs since.", "Sometimes world affairs intervene to create challenges for the fairs, such as in the fall of 2008, which saw, first, the Russo-Georgian war in August and the global economic collapse in September. The impact of both events was apparent at the 2008 Frankfurt Book Fair, where the stands of Greece, Iceland, and Ireland stood nearly empty as a result of the economic crisis, and the Georgian stand, in close proximity to Russia\u2019s stand, staged a days-long protest in which Georgians bombarded the Russian stand with paper airplanes made from pages torn out of Russian books.", "This year the United Arab Emirate of Sharjah will be the guest of honor country at Bologna, Frankfurt, and Guadalajara\u2014an unusual confluence, signaling the emirate\u2019s ambitions. Most international book fairs will feature a guest of honor, typically a country or a region, and will highlight that country\u2019s authors and literary culture through talks, performances, and other cultural programming. The most prestigious of these programs is Frankfurt\u2019s, which often entails translating several hundred of a guest of honor country\u2019s titles into German. Some small nations, including Iceland and Finland, as well as larger ones that are less familiar to global readers, such as Indonesia and Turkey, have used a showcase in Frankfurt as a means of generating broader international interest", ". Le Cl\u00e9zio had won the Nobel, the stand of his French publisher, Gallimard, was mobbed by potential rights buyers. Anne-Solange Nobel, Gallimard\u2019s foreign rights director at the time, announced, \u201cIf you have not bought rights from me for him before, then I will not sell you rights to him today, so go away!\u201d", ". Taipei has been a popular book fair with international visitors, many seeing it as a literary gateway to mainland China, but the threat of invasion from China may prompt many of them to stay away for some time.", ". In contrast, both Bologna and London only allow professionals to attend and typically draw 30,000 and 25,000 attendees, respectively.", "Most fairs have some form of a dedicated rights center, an area where agents, foreign rights directors, and publishers can meet to negotiate deals. The template for this kind of activity was established by the Frankfurt Book Fair, which created the LitAg, or Literary Agent\u2019s Center, in 1978. The LitAg features dozens of rows of small tables, none bigger than a middle schooler\u2019s desk, dedicated to an agency or publishing house. There will be found one or two people on each side of the table, often in heated conversation, flipping through portfolios of titles and discussing deals. It feels a little like a stock market trading floor. Entry is restricted to those who have an appointment, and security is tight to prevent agents from being distracted by aspiring authors. At the busiest fairs, meetings are booked in half-hour clusters, back-to-back, for six to eight hours a day for the length of the fair", ". All this would happen over three or four days, and the concentrated time frame of the fair amplified the excitement, which, anecdotally at least, helped drive up the purchase price of rights.", "For several decades, due to a coincidence of timing, both the U.K.\u2019s Booker Prize and the Nobel Prize were announced at some point during the week of Frankfurt, prompting a rush on rights for the winning author\u2019s books. The Booker announcement always happened at night, with a watch party at the bar of the Frankfurter Hof Hotel (the primary after-hours party venue for fairgoers), and it seemed for long stretches of the 2000s that the U.S. publisher of the winning book was inevitably Grove Atlantic. It became a foregone conclusion that publisher Morgan Entrekin would buy a round of drinks for anyone in the vicinity. The Nobel Prize news would come in the morning, prompting a large cheer and a rush of people to the booth of whoever was the primary rights holder for the author\u2019s books. This has produced some memorable scenes and airing of grievances, such as in 2008, when after it was announced that J.M.G", "Despite returning to live events this year, the fear remains among the fair organizers that as publishers become accustomed to doing business digitally, they will feel less and less compelled to travel to meet with colleagues in real life. Going into 2022, for the first time in many people\u2019s careers, the relevance and importance of attending in-person events is being questioned. Going back, say, to the early 1990s, it wasn\u2019t always so. Social media didn\u2019t yet exist, nor did Zoom. Face-to-face meetings and negotiations at book fairs were a high priority. Publishers would fly to a fair and take their most important meetings first, hoping to get their hands on the hottest manuscripts. A savvy publisher would make time between other meetings and socializing to speed read the book and, ideally, offer a preempt large enough to entice a publisher to commit. If enough parties were interested, the seller might then hold an auction", ". Frankfurt has retained the crown as the busiest agents center and has doubled in size in the past 30 years, now hosting some 500 tables representing 350 different literary agencies. In 2000, Reuters estimated that fully 80% of the rights deals for all books were done in Frankfurt. That number is now likely smaller, for in the past decade the London Book Fair, which has a smaller agents center, has surpassed Frankfurt\u2019s importance for English-language rights trading. The biggest, most important rights deals, when they are done, are celebrated after-hours with Champagne in Frankfurt, pints in London, or a glass of good Barolo in Bologna.", "Over the past decade, one book fair that has come out of nowhere is the Sharjah International Book Fair, in the United Arab Emirates, which has made a strong push into rights trading, particularly among smaller, overlooked markets. It has been generous in sponsoring publishers and agents to participate and offers financial incentives for striking deals at the fair and payment for covering translation costs.

Will hotels accommodate and maintain social distance for thousands of trade show visitors?", "International book fairs are crucial to the book chain.

Robert Gottlieb, chairman of the Trident Media Group, countered by saying that \u201cthe fair plays a central role in the rights business for us from hand selling to personal relationships, which we value and depend on when managing our clients careers.\u201d", "I would add that book fairs are especially valuable for the buying and selling of rights in the international arena\u2014across all continents. Further, many of our fairs are public events\u2014Guadalajara, for example, has 820,000 visitors and Buenos Aires well over a million\u2014and play an instrumental role in getting books to readers in countries, like Mexico and Colombia, with a dismal bookselling infrastructure. Further, the Latin American book fairs are the venues for librarians and Spanish-language distributors to purchase books for the nearly 60 million Latinos who live in the U.S. and frequent American libraries to read books to strengthen their reading skills and read their favorite Latin American authors.", "So that brings us to the traditional fall international book fairs set for Goteborg, Frankfurt, Sharjah, and Guadalajara. As of this writing, all the fairs are scheduled to go on, perhaps in a less than traditional way. Goteborg is considering two options, with or without exhibitors, which will still focus on its strong seminar and writers program, and a reduced Scandinavian rights business. Frankfurt, the pre-eminent rights fair in the world, is planning a number of changes, but says it will definitely be held in October. Sharjah, with its unique translation grants, has yet to announce plans for its early November fair.

In this article, we will explore why authors should get involved in book fairs and how to make the most of this unique platform.\nWhy Authors Should Get Involved in Book Fairs\nExposure and Visibility", "One of the primary reasons authors should participate in book fairs is the exposure and visibility it offers.

Ensure that your booth or display is visually appealing and reflects the essence of your work. Create eye-catching banners, promotional materials, and a professional author bio. Be ready to engage with visitors, answer questions about your book, and provide signed copies.\nNetwork Effectively", "Networking is a significant part of the book fair experience. Prepare a concise elevator pitch for your book and yourself as an author. Be approachable and open to conversations with fellow authors, publishers, and literary agents. Attend networking events, social gatherings, and panel discussions to expand your connections.\nPromote Your Participation\nBefore the book fair, create a buzz around your participation on social media, your website, and through email newsletters. Let your readers know where and when they can meet you. Encourage your existing fans to spread the word and consider organizing book giveaways or contests to generate excitement.\nPlan Book Signings and Readings\nBook signings and readings are excellent opportunities to engage with readers and create memorable experiences. Schedule these events at your booth or participate in any book fair-sponsored author events. Promote your signings in advance to ensure a good turnout.\nBe Prepared for Follow-Ups", "After the book fair concludes, be prepared to follow up with the connections you\u2019ve made.

There\u2019s something very special about setting up at a community college campus in the middle of the downtown and seeing tens of thousands of people from South Florida streaming through and actively participating in this literary culture that at times throughout history has been seen as meant for others\u2014White, formally educated at elite schools, wealthy, male, etc. There\u2019s nothing rarefied about what we do. Nothing opaque.", "Steph Opitz: Wordplay was, I think, the first literary festival to go fully virtual. We announced in March that we were taking it online, and went from a one day festival (May 9th) to a five week festival (mid April\u2013May 9). My colleagues and I felt like having everything on one day might be a little intense in terms of the viewers staring at a screen and from a tech perspective, so we ended up doing about 8\u201310 events a week. Given the timing and speediness of our pivot, we were navigating along with our authors on everything from how to do a Zoom call to the sudden shift in schedules (working from home, kids around, etc.).", "How has your festival stayed the same? What is lost this year, what could you NOT translate online or to adapted programming?\nSteph Opitz: We featured 100 authors with new books in curated conversation, which is what we aim to do each year. We lost the ability to do some really special (and in some cases irreverent) in-person events that we couldn\u2019t wrap our heads around adapting in execution or spirit online, like a bird watching expedition with Jeff VanderMeer and a flip-cup tournament Danez Smith and I were planning.", "Lissette Mendez: We decided to create a Miami Book Fair website that could work a bit like a Netflix or Hulu platform\u2014the conversations and interviews and all the other programs would be on demand. We would also schedule lives\u2014so there\u2019s a variety of types of interactions. But we wanted to take as much advantage of the tech as possible\u2014as time and resources allowed. We wanted to solve multiple problems when going online. Not just the pandemic-related problem of no in-person events. I have a demanding job, two kids and a number of obligations to my extended family, so appointment television hasn\u2019t worked for me for years.

There have been events I have attended with surprisingly tremendous audiences of very engaged attendees, that I can\u2019t really picture being able to reproduce regionally. But there are also events that are incredibly special and the audience size doesn\u2019t represent that. I worry that there might be a really celebrity-driven (literary celeb or otherwise) lean to the success of an online event and what that will do to the whole economy of literary events.\nAmanda Bullock: I share your nervousness about the balance, Steph. It\u2019s hard enough for the 99% of authors who are not celebrities already, and this is making that imbalance more pronounced, I think. You\u2019re right about the audience size not defining some of the \u201cbest\u201d events, the most memorable about connection. Sometimes being a part of a large audience is part of that, but often it\u2019s not. The flatness of online makes that really difficult.", ".

When we made the decision to pivot away from a virtual festival, we felt committed to offering programs over radio, because radio is a grand equalizer. Not to mention, Zoom burnout is very real. A listener doesn\u2019t need a wi-fi connection; and a listener can tune from the car. A listener doesn\u2019t need a babysitter to enjoy the program. A listener doesn\u2019t need transportation to arrive at a venue. I\u2019m interested in radio as a democratic medium, especially when there is so much inequity in this world. By the nature of radio, most can listen with few barriers of entry. Our audience grows at least ten times over.

I just hope we survive; our festivals are all nonprofits who depend on grants and sponsorships and we were able to cover costs this year because of not having an in-person event. Another reason we built a website that will be relatively easy to keep up. But in general what will the economy look like in years to come? Will we be able to support our organizations?

Jackson mentioned we\u2019ve probably never been in the national news more. With the Portland Book Festival specifically (Literary Arts houses several other programs as well), we knew for two years that this year\u2019s festival was going to be the Saturday after the election, and I thought that was going to be our biggest challenge in 2020. It\u2019s still a challenge, especially because we don\u2019t truly know when the election will actually end . . . There are a number of events within the festival designed to create space to respond to the election; although I believe all art is political (whether it intends to be or not) and it will come up pretty much everywhere, we did want to structure some specific conversation around it, no matter what happens", "Conor Moran: In addition to our fall celebration (60 events over four days), the Wisconsin Book Festival hosts about 40 stand-alone events throughout the year, so we were hosting virtual events about two and a half weeks after we left the office. Initially we were really just caught up in the rescheduling of authors we\u2019d booked for the spring, which gave way pretty quickly to recognizing that maybe there were opportunities with authors who might not otherwise have been available. This actually led to some fantastic collaborative events with other Festivals, including our upcoming event with the Portland Book Festival, The Believer Festival, and The Loft\u2019s Wordplay to host Claudia Rankine in November.", "Our goal is to make everyone feel comfortable enough to come and check it out and see how awesome books and reading is, how much they can enhance our lives, and hopefully we make everyone feel welcome. That\u2019s how I experienced the Fair as a teenager from a poor, immigrant, single-parent family with no particularly special educational experiences, and some downright awful ones\u2026 and it really made such an impact on my life that finding myself in the position to bring the magic of books and the Book Fair to as many people as possible I\u2019ve made it my life\u2019s work.", "We hosted a year-long series on elections and voting rights with our bookselling partners at A Room of One\u2019s Own Bookstore.

I think digital events are very fruitful ground to bring author events directly to people wherever they are. I don\u2019t see a model for in-person events in the future that doesn\u2019t involve a streaming element. (Sara seconds this!) We\u2019ve seen such growth in who is able to attend events regardless of when they watch. We\u2019re seeing about 35% of the live audience watching the events in the week after as replays, so it\u2019s clearly working for people who might have to deal with putting kids to bed or alternative work schedules or bad weather and won\u2019t want to leave the house some nights.

We work each year to be responsive to not only what is being published, but what is being discussed in our newspapers, our offices, our classrooms. This year, decisions on how to program for the national and global nature of the audience took many forms.", "Amanda Bullock: For me, having to rethink the event caused some existential questions. What is the Portland Book Festival? What is a book festival? I don\u2019t know if I have the answers even now, but we did want to keep some Portland identity to the event. I hope we are known for stellar curation\u2014a place where you can see literary superstars but also catch exciting new talent\u2014and a diverse lineup, and I think we are offering that again this year. In terms of what is a book festival, I think one of the defining aspects is the density of programming, which allows for discovery, so we didn\u2019t want to lose that either.", "Sara Ortiz: Believer editors Neila Orr and Ismail Muhammad are shepherding Black Talk Black Feeling, a series of roundtables that seek to connect this critical moment and contribute to a continuum of Black literary responses to issues of urgent importance. In a couple weeks, BMI is hosting a workshop for UNLV\u2019s MFA creative writing students led by Felicia Chavez on \u201cHow to Decolonize the Creative Classroom.\u201d Equally exciting is that Black Mountain Radio is produced and designed by an entirely women of color team. There is always room for learning, unlearning, listening, and betterment. Most organizations, including ours, can always make room for voices and perspectives that challenge traditional systems. Our team is working as a staff through monthly equity and inclusion meetings\u2014though, I should note that we began those discussions over a year ago before the protest movements of the summer.", "Sara Ortiz: Drastically. The main way The Believer Festival changed is that it\u2019s not happening. The festival is an unorthodox, majestic, roving festival that takes place in the desert, and it was challenging to visualize a virtual festival (we\u2019d be happy with). Rather than producing a virtual festival, we pivoted our programming into interactive experiences and imaginative directions for our audiences. We\u2019ve done this through various distinct gatherings: For over 24 weeks, The Believer\u2019s art director Kristen Radtke has stewarded our weekly comics workshops featuring various illustrators and hundreds of weekly participants; for 14 weeks, we hosted Severance Radio, an on-air book club in which listeners would hear a live broadcast of Severance by Ling Ma; and most recently, we launched Black Mountain Radio, an artist-driven and community-focused audio project.", "Sara Ortiz is the program and festival director of The Believer magazine and Black Mountain Institute.

I\u2019m really proud of the festival we\u2019ve built this year with the constraints and circumstances facing us, but what is lost with moving to virtual in terms of author/book events is so much more than what we\u2019re gaining. And I think that authors, especially not-super-famous authors, are losing the most: book sales are really difficult in this environment (please buy books from the bookstores hosting the events you are attending (Steph enthusiastically chiming in to second this) (Conor too!)), and authors are missing the opportunity to connect with their readers and also, critically, with each other. As much as we try to be excellent hosts and keep things grounded in Portland, there is no real place in this digital environment and that makes it really, really difficult to feel connected", "And again: BUY BOOKS. From independent bookstores hosting or supporting these events. While here are many things that make a successful, memorable event, the authors, publishers, and bookstores need you to buy books, if you can.\nSara Ortiz: I\u2019m surprised\u2014and not surprised\u2014by the programmer\u2019s and director\u2019s endurance. Though, I\u2019m even more stunned and impressed by the audience\u2019s stamina to engage digitally. We\u2019re nearing eight months of this new normal, and my original guess was that the landscape would change a great deal after six months. I\u2019m no optimist, but I\u2019m hopeful about the future of literary programs. Though, if this year has taught us anything, it\u2019s that good things can be taken away from us in a snap.", "Steph Opitz: I asked Loft\u2019s ED Britt Udesen to respond: The Loft has completely shifted the way that we present our programs, with not only a necessary move to becoming virtual, but to making programs free and accessible. This has encouraged us to create new revenue streams and alter our funding plan, our work plan, and our vision for how we serve our community. We\u2019ve also dug even deeper into the work of becoming an actively ant-racist organization. It\u2019s a long process but one we\u2019re putting at the center of our decisions.

Maybe we wait a week to post the replay to maintain the immediacy of being in the room. Maybe we only stream part of the event.

For instance, The Kristen Arnett Show was pure silliness mixed with high lit, a welcome respite at the beginning of the quarantine lock-down; The Believer comics workshops put strangers from all over the world on the digital stage; and Black Mountain Radio is about making common space through sound. Our programs continue to offer participants (drawers, listeners, readers) a chance to hear stories, learn from artists, and engage in an exchange of ideas\u2014all while discovering established and emerging voices. As for what is lost: it\u2019s the human connection. It\u2019s the community\u2019s in-person engagement with the authors and artists. It\u2019s standing in line with a book or two in hand, waiting to ask an author the question/comment that one holds onto for that private exchange. It\u2019s those shared a-ha moments with the people sitting next to each other. Also, virtual applause is not the same.", "Lissette Mendez: We wanted to keep true to the spirit of Miami Book Fair so we wanted to keep the programs that our audiences appreciate. So we kept our children\u2019s activity areas and our Florida-centric, interdisciplinary programs and our Street Fair marketplace (minus the Street Fair.) It\u2019s the same programming team as always so there\u2019s that. And we wanted there to be easy access to our partner bookshop Books & Books for book purchases\u2014just like at the Fair where they are in every building right outside the venues\u2014we have made links to the store from every event and author bios. We really wanted to be Miami Book Fair\u2014online, but recognizably us.", "We had many people who attended multiple events, but there just weren\u2019t the same moments of serendipity or immersion that we tend to see. Fewer people making new friends who they discover have similar interests and more people inviting their friends to things (which isn\u2019t a bad trade off at all). There\u2019s an essential something that is missing without a signing line as well. Just that moment where people get to meet an author they admire and tell them a bit about what their work has meant. We see some of it in the chat at events, but it\u2019s a little harder to capture.\n*\nWhat virtual/digital/online/remote adaptations do you think might carry forward once we are able to gather in person again?\nSteph Opitz: Digital question asking. I love the ability to vet questions, prevent \u201cthis is more of a comment than a question\u201d types, and have the audience vote on which questions they most want to hear the answer to. It\u2019s really raised the bar for the audience Q&A.", "Amanda Bullock: Sara, I agree about radio and audio programming. Literary Arts already had a radio show and podcast, though we did expand it this past summer with a podcast-only interview series. It\u2019s so accessible to so many more people. I think meeting people\u2014whether the audience, the author, etc.\u2014where they\u2019re at is more important than ever right now, because you never know the full complexity of what someone might be navigating in these overlapping crises. I mean, I barely understand what I am navigating, much less what anyone else is. On a less, like, existential level I think that the video streams are great for a lot of events mainly because they do offer a space for the audience members to connect with each other, but with so many book events being conversation-based audio is a logical format for many of the things we are doing.", "Conor Moran: This year there were many conversations about capacity and trying to gauge audience interest without knowing what would be happening in the world months in the future. We decided to offer fewer events over the one weekend and add more standalones in the fall. We stayed true to the type of lineup we typically have: many different types of people on many different topics and we saw that the audience really was interested. Ultimately, the biggest loss was what I often refer to \u201cthe festival atmosphere.\u201d We keep the footprint of the Wisconsin Book Festival pretty small. No venues that you can\u2019t walk to in the breaks between events. Because of that a typical year sees people coming downtown for the day, staying for lunch or dinner, walking around the venue, perusing books, finding out about an author or an event they hadn\u2019t known about, or even just staying in the same seat all day long.", "Lissette Mendez: I feel the same as Amanda.

Authors, readers, and booksellers turned to platforms like Zoom and Teams to host virtual events, showcasing books and connecting with a wider audience [1].\n\nVirtual book fairs, like The Festival of Storytellers (TFOS), have provided authors with cost-effective opportunities to market their books and attract new readers [2].

Thanks to modern streaming and video platforms, authors and readers are able to connect in a way that would have been impossible if the pandemic had happened a few years ago.", "The Cons of Digital Book Festivals\nWhile digital book festivals and events have many advantages, there are drawbacks to every medium. While authors have welcomed the opportunity to connect with a wider audience, and to take part in events without the travel time that takes away from their writing, there\u2019s the counterpoint that book sales related to online events can be much lower than those at offline literary festivals. (Blackwell\u2019s is addressing this by offering digital attendees the option to buy a book alongside a ticket to a launch or event). This, combined with the fact that schools may expect to pay less (or nothing) for a digital author event, has led to a significant drop in income for many authors \u2013 the scale of this loss of income can be seen in the fact that the Society of Authors paid out over \u00a31.3 million in hardship funding to authors during 2020.", "During 2020 and the beginning of 2021, I attended several digital book festivals and author events. Each festival approached the business of setting up a purely digital event in a different way, facing a variety of challenges when it came to managing a festival in unprecedented circumstances. All of the events, however, had one thing in common; a core team of tenacious story-lovers, determined to make sure that no matter what the pandemic threw at them, they would bring their book festival to locked-down readers.\nStandalone Storyfests", "While FIYAHCON had its inaugural year in 2020, many older festivals that had previously run offline adapted to the new normal. Noirwich, the Norwich-based crime writing festival, moved online, with the majority of their sessions available for free. I sat in on the talks by Attica Locke and Oyinkan Braithwaite, and caught up later on the festival\u2019s talk on \u2018Poirot: The Greatest Detective in the World\u2019 (a title that Hercule would no doubt consider highly deserved).\nSadly, several offline book festivals had to be cancelled. Authors Kit de Waal and Molly Flatt quickly stepped in, starting work on the Big Book Weekend as early as March 2020. This event brought together 28 sessions from cancelled festivals and broadcast them on My Virtual Literary Festival, including appearances from authors such as Neil Gaiman, Juno Dawson, and Booker Prize winner Bernardine Evaristo. The sessions are available on My VLF until the end of April, so make sure you watch them before they\u2019re taken down!", "One of the biggest digital book festivals I attended was FIYAHCON 2020, the inaugural festival hosted by FIYAH Literary Magazine. FIYAH is a quarterly magazine publishing Black speculative fiction, which has been going strong since 2017, and FIYAHCON built on the magazine\u2019s legacy of success. Director L.D. Lewis and the rest of the FIYAH team were determined to create \u2018an inclusive, accessible, diverse, dynamic convention where people and entities have their names properly announced and see more than one brown face on a panel at a time on anything other than a Diversity Panel\u2019, and FIYAHCON more than delivered on this promise. The initial release of 500 tickets sold out almost immediately, and the final number of registered attendees was 1,128 \u2013 a staggering number for a brand-new, entirely online literary convention.", "Digital events have very different requirements to in-person events, and this is particularly clear when it comes to security. While offline event organisers might be used to setting up guest lists or hiring security professionals, the dangers associated with online events can be much less predictable. An author event run by a Yorkshire-based school was hacked by an outside group who posted explicit sexual content, showing that safeguarding can be a much greater challenge when hosting online events than their offline counterparts. Conversely, online attendees can themselves pose a risk; author Dhonielle Clayton was subjected to racist abuse by students with their video screens turned off during a Zoom author event at a school. While authors can of course face bigoted abuse and harassment at in-person events, the level of anonymity that potential abusers can hide behind during online events means that there is less chance of accountability and consequences for such abuse.", "Some digital book festivals have broken away from the \u201cone week/end\u201d format altogether, and put together extended events programmes that have been running throughout lockdown. Lockdown LitFest has featured interviews with a huge range of authors, running regularly over the past year. The famous Blackwell\u2019s bookshop in Oxford has kept up their roster of stellar literary events, moving them over to Zoom. Cambridge Literary Festival has a timetable of fascinating online events, available to watch live or on catch-up for a couple of days afterwards. Individual authors have been running their own events. Elle McNicoll, author of A Kind of Spark, has been running a YouTube writing class aimed at young readers, while children\u2019s poet Michael Rosen has filled his channel with poetry readings and workshops", "For me, online book festivals made a bad situation so much more manageable. I was working from home and missing my friends and family; digital book festivals gave me something to look forward to at weekends or in the evenings, and gave me the feeling of being away from the same four walls, day in, day out. At the same time, I was finally starting to manage my chronic illnesses \u2013 where in-person book festivals wore me out (if I didn\u2019t skip them completely), digital book festivals were much more manageable and accessible. Thanks to some of the festivals recording their sessions, I could even dip in and out when I felt like it, which gave me a lot more time to process and enjoy the author talks and panel discussions.", "Digital book festivals have created greater accessibility in many ways, but they\u2019re not a perfect medium, and some accessibility challenges still remain. Captions are not standard across all platforms, making it difficult for Deaf attendees to participate. Participation in digital book festivals depends on having a stable internet connection, something that isn\u2019t a guarantee for every reader (or indeed every author). For some authors and panellists, an online book event might be more draining than an offline one; without the feedback and energy from a room full of readers, even the most dynamic digital event can feel jarring.\nGoing Forward", "For a look back at offline book festivals, check out one Rioter\u2019s post on Why You Should Go To Book Festivals.

The several book fairs of the summer and fall follow: Beijing International Book Fair and Frankfurt Book Fair held, respectively, in August or September and October. The fairs rounding out the year include those in Guadalajara, Mexico, and Sharjah, UAE. A slew of other fairs are also of some international, but primarily regional, importance, including those in Abu Dhabi, Brussels, Buenos Aires, Bogot\u00e1, Cairo, Gothenburg, Istanbul, Jerusalem, Kyiv, Leipzig, Montreal, Moscow, New Delhi, Paris, Prague, S\u00e3o Paulo, Seoul, Taipei, and Thessaloniki. One could spend the entire calendar year just traveling to book fairs.", "Sometimes world affairs intervene to create challenges for the fairs, such as in the fall of 2008, which saw, first, the Russo-Georgian war in August and the global economic collapse in September. The impact of both events was apparent at the 2008 Frankfurt Book Fair, where the stands of Greece, Iceland, and Ireland stood nearly empty as a result of the economic crisis, and the Georgian stand, in close proximity to Russia\u2019s stand, staged a days-long protest in which Georgians bombarded the Russian stand with paper airplanes made from pages torn out of Russian books.", "Fast forward to 2022. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is likely to cause ripples on the international book fair scene as well, though the full impact is uncertain at press time. For starters, nearly all the major international book fairs announced they have banned Russia\u2019s state-sponsored publishers and booksellers from exhibiting at their fairs, though independent publishers will be allowed. The primary concern is that the war will spill over into other countries in Europe and create hesitation among fairgoers about traveling to the fairs or exhibiting; this would have significant consequences for both Bologna and London. Both fairs have been idle for two years due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and each had offered virtual alternatives in both 2020 and 2021. Most people found these virtual events less than satisfying, however, and it is urgent that the fairs return to in-person events as soon as possible, lest fairgoers lose their sense of loyalty.", "Frankfurt, Beijing, and Guadalajara also went digital in 2020, and then each returned with scaled-down in-person events in 2021. Having benefited from its late date in the year, Sharjah was able to hold a modest book fair at the end of 2020, then returned in 2021 with its full show. Thus, Sharjah could take bragging rights to being the biggest book fair in the world last year, attracting 1.3 million people, compared with just 75,000 in 2021 for Frankfurt, which would typically bring in some 300,000, and Guadalajara, which allowed in just 200,000 people, when it would usually host more than 700,000. The Beijing fair was said to be half its usual size in 2021, which generally brings in 300,000 people. All these fairs are not exclusive to publishing professionals and cater to some extent to consumers and members of the public, who account for most of the attendees", ". In contrast, both Bologna and London only allow professionals to attend and typically draw 30,000 and 25,000 attendees, respectively.", "These large numbers of people spend a lot of money and, accordingly, represent a huge, predictable influx of cash into the community hosting a book fair. Some people take advantage of this, such as the hoteliers in Frankfurt who triple their rates during the fair. When Covid-19 shut down the fairs, national governments were compelled to step in and shore up the finances of the organizers to ensure the fair would keep going. Still, Covid did have some consequences: Jacks Thomas, director of the London Book Fair for seven years, retired, then started working with Bologna, while Frankfurt closed several overseas offices and significantly reduced its overall staff numbers.", "Despite returning to live events this year, the fear remains among the fair organizers that as publishers become accustomed to doing business digitally, they will feel less and less compelled to travel to meet with colleagues in real life. Going into 2022, for the first time in many people\u2019s careers, the relevance and importance of attending in-person events is being questioned. Going back, say, to the early 1990s, it wasn\u2019t always so. Social media didn\u2019t yet exist, nor did Zoom. Face-to-face meetings and negotiations at book fairs were a high priority. Publishers would fly to a fair and take their most important meetings first, hoping to get their hands on the hottest manuscripts. A savvy publisher would make time between other meetings and socializing to speed read the book and, ideally, offer a preempt large enough to entice a publisher to commit. If enough parties were interested, the seller might then hold an auction", ". All this would happen over three or four days, and the concentrated time frame of the fair amplified the excitement, which, anecdotally at least, helped drive up the purchase price of rights.", "Most fairs have some form of a dedicated rights center, an area where agents, foreign rights directors, and publishers can meet to negotiate deals. The template for this kind of activity was established by the Frankfurt Book Fair, which created the LitAg, or Literary Agent\u2019s Center, in 1978. The LitAg features dozens of rows of small tables, none bigger than a middle schooler\u2019s desk, dedicated to an agency or publishing house. There will be found one or two people on each side of the table, often in heated conversation, flipping through portfolios of titles and discussing deals. It feels a little like a stock market trading floor. Entry is restricted to those who have an appointment, and security is tight to prevent agents from being distracted by aspiring authors. At the busiest fairs, meetings are booked in half-hour clusters, back-to-back, for six to eight hours a day for the length of the fair", ". Frankfurt has retained the crown as the busiest agents center and has doubled in size in the past 30 years, now hosting some 500 tables representing 350 different literary agencies. In 2000, Reuters estimated that fully 80% of the rights deals for all books were done in Frankfurt. That number is now likely smaller, for in the past decade the London Book Fair, which has a smaller agents center, has surpassed Frankfurt\u2019s importance for English-language rights trading. The biggest, most important rights deals, when they are done, are celebrated after-hours with Champagne in Frankfurt, pints in London, or a glass of good Barolo in Bologna.", "For several decades, due to a coincidence of timing, both the U.K.\u2019s Booker Prize and the Nobel Prize were announced at some point during the week of Frankfurt, prompting a rush on rights for the winning author\u2019s books. The Booker announcement always happened at night, with a watch party at the bar of the Frankfurter Hof Hotel (the primary after-hours party venue for fairgoers), and it seemed for long stretches of the 2000s that the U.S. publisher of the winning book was inevitably Grove Atlantic. It became a foregone conclusion that publisher Morgan Entrekin would buy a round of drinks for anyone in the vicinity. The Nobel Prize news would come in the morning, prompting a large cheer and a rush of people to the booth of whoever was the primary rights holder for the author\u2019s books. This has produced some memorable scenes and airing of grievances, such as in 2008, when after it was announced that J.M.G", ". Le Cl\u00e9zio had won the Nobel, the stand of his French publisher, Gallimard, was mobbed by potential rights buyers. Anne-Solange Nobel, Gallimard\u2019s foreign rights director at the time, announced, \u201cIf you have not bought rights from me for him before, then I will not sell you rights to him today, so go away!\u201d", "Over the past decade, one book fair that has come out of nowhere is the Sharjah International Book Fair, in the United Arab Emirates, which has made a strong push into rights trading, particularly among smaller, overlooked markets. It has been generous in sponsoring publishers and agents to participate and offers financial incentives for striking deals at the fair and payment for covering translation costs. The fair is one part of an overall project by the Sharjah Book Authority to help the emirate become a publishing hub for the Middle East and Africa.", "This year the United Arab Emirate of Sharjah will be the guest of honor country at Bologna, Frankfurt, and Guadalajara\u2014an unusual confluence, signaling the emirate\u2019s ambitions. Most international book fairs will feature a guest of honor, typically a country or a region, and will highlight that country\u2019s authors and literary culture through talks, performances, and other cultural programming. The most prestigious of these programs is Frankfurt\u2019s, which often entails translating several hundred of a guest of honor country\u2019s titles into German. Some small nations, including Iceland and Finland, as well as larger ones that are less familiar to global readers, such as Indonesia and Turkey, have used a showcase in Frankfurt as a means of generating broader international interest", ". China, too, has used this platform and was the guest of honor at Frankfurt in 2009 and then London in 2012, but encountered aggressive protests, particularly from groups supporting Uyghurs; it has largely abandoned large-scale participation in global fairs since.", "The popularity and importance of any given book fair ebbs and flows over time and is often subject to the politics and economics of a given country. The Buenos Aires Book Fair, for example, is the second largest in the Spanish-language world, but a crash in the value of the peso has meant Argentine publishers have been less able to buy rights or export books. Consequently, the Bogot\u00e1 Book Fair has risen to more prominence in recent years as a result of a more stable Colombian government. In another example, the S\u00e3o Paolo book fair was actively wooing international business in the decade preceding the election of Jair Bolsonaro to the presidency of Brazil, but that largely stopped after the conservative politician took power. The book fair in Moscow began wooing foreign journalists again in 2016, though that is unlikely to resume anytime soon", ". Taipei has been a popular book fair with international visitors, many seeing it as a literary gateway to mainland China, but the threat of invasion from China may prompt many of them to stay away for some time.", "Still, attending an international book fair is a rite of passage for a young person in publishing and a step to career advancement. A trip to Beijing or Bologna, Frankfurt or Guadalajara, London or Sharjah says, \u201cHey, look, I am someone\u201d\u2014someone of status, ambition, vision, or someone with some really good books to sell.\nSo what does the international book fair of the future look like? It may, indeed, be a mixture of physical, in-person events and the continuation of virtual experiences we have seen burgeoning over the past two years. The 2010s saw the launch of at least two new platforms meant to facilitate digital rights trading activity, including PubMatch (partially owned by PW), which works with Bologna, among other fairs, and Frankfurt Rights, which is administered by the Frankfurt Book Fair. Neither platform has supplanted face-to-face meetings, nor were they meant to. Relationship building, however enacted, remains the bedrock of the international publishing industry.", "It is true, however, that fairs offer something unique: serendipity. Ask almost any publisher who regularly attends fairs, and they are likely to have a story about how a chance meeting on a bus, in a bar, or in a bathroom led to their discovering a great book. This gamble that serendipity will pay off is perhaps what drives people to return to fairs time and time again: the chance of stumbling on the next global megaselling book and making it your own."], "title": "International Book Fairs Still Thrive in the Digital Age"}, {"url": "https://www.fondazionelia.org/en/whats-new/book-fairs-accessibility-overview/", "description": "2.

Without being able to access the facilities and the services found in the community, persons with disabilities will never be fully included. In most societies, however, there are innumerable obstacles and barriers that hinder persons with disabilities. These include such things as stairs, lack of information in accessible formats such as Braille and sign language, and community services provided in a form which persons with disabilities are not able to access. This principle applies either to physical or digital spaces.", "Getting to know users\u2019 needs and working alongside organizations representing persons with disabilities and with accessibility experts is important to learn more on the subject and foster the adoption of accessible solutions. Furthermore, the adoption of the \u2018Universal Design\u201d approach, also defined \u201cBorn accessible\u201d, should become the driving value for any activity in order to allow everyone to have a rich experience.\nMore specifically, for the accessibility of the physical spaces could be useful the designation of a responsible person, professional training for the personnel, the provision of different kinds of signage, and customized services for people with disabilities. Supporting the exhibitors to better enhance the experience of the visitors during their staying and offering services for sign language interpretation during the event or conference and for subtitles and closed captions during online events could be further initiatives to put in place.", "A crucial aspect of accessibility in every organization and in every field, is the development of a culture of accessibility, encompassing different aspects, with the goal to make it a shared value rather than a responsibility of a single team or department. At this regard, most of the book fairs already considered how to improve the physical fair experience for people with disabilities: a fair collected opinions about its level of accessibility among persons with disabilities, another one asked visitors\u2019 feedbacks about their experience, two of them trained some employees on the theme, and the majority has already established different partnerships with organizations representing persons with disabilities.\nAs for Universal Design \u2013 the design of products, environments, programmes, and services to be usable by all people without the need for adaptation \u2013 it is still a practice already adopted by half of the book fairs.\n2.

Communication channels\nThe third area of research was the accessibility of digital communication channels with the goal to understand how book fairs communicate digitally to their visitors, both professionals of the book sector and generic public.\nAccessibility, especially related to digital communication activities, is still a new topic for bookfair as it is for the publishing industry.", "Accessibility of physical spaces is the area where many initiatives are already in place.

Rest areas, meeting and conference areas and wardrobes are in most of the cases accessible, according to the respondents. Reserved parking slots for people with disabilities are also available in a large majority of book fairs.\nFurthermore, reduced or free tickets are also available in most of the cases, and most of book fairs have appointed a responsible to take care of accessibility.\nOrientation is a crucial issue for people with a sensory impairment such as persons with sight or hearing loss or that have a physical disability. The most used signages are visual and audio, some fairs have both audio and visual signage, but only one has tactile-plantar signage.", "As for videos, widely used especially in the pandemic years during online events and conferences, it is important to provide subtitles and closed captions. Captions are designed for viewers who cannot hear the audio in a video, while subtitles are designed for viewers who can hear, but do not understand the language spoken in the video. As some fairs are already providing these services, many others state that are working on it.\n4. Accessibility initiatives\nIn this section accessibility has been analysed regarding the inclusion in the professional program of events organized during the fairs or in specific events addressing the inclusion of people with disabilities in the cultural program.", "At this purpose, Fondazione LIA, an Italian not for profit organization that promotes the culture of accessibility in the publishing field, carried out a survey about the accessibility of European book fairs, under the coordination of the Book studies department of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU) and in collaboration with the Research Department of the Italian Publishers Association.", "In this scenario, many publishers are nowadays in the process of adapting their production and distribution workflows to provide e-books that are accessible since their first publications and services such as research and purchase fitting the needs of print disabled users. This shift will also improve their capacity to increase readers \u2018engagement, by making the wide EU catalogue of digital publications available to everyone.\nOn the other hand, being a reader is not only about reading books, but even about connecting with authors, publishers and other readers. Since physical and digital book fairs are important social and cultural occasions to build a bridge between the publishing world and the audience, accessibility is one of the main topics of interest of the Aldus Up \u2013 Building Bridges in the Book World, a large-scale cooperation project co-funded in the framework of Creative Europe Programme 2014-2020.", "Events can be an effective way of promoting and communicating accessibility, by offering book professionals the opportunity to widen their knowledge and skills on how to create and distribute accessible publications. They can also promote awareness on the relevance for everyone to access to contents among the general public. Between 2019 and 2020, apart from some exceptions, due the pandemic the overall number of meetings and conferences offered by book fairs has diminished remarkably.\nApart from the exceptional situation of 2020, answers show that 15 book fairs out of 16 have a programme of meetings and conferences. Until now, 4 book fairs have already organized events and online seminars about accessibility for the professional audience, often in collaboration with Fondazione LIA. The European Accessibility Act and its implications for the publishing industry have been the main topic of these events.", "Moreover, a deeper knowledge of what digital accessibility means in terms of standards, formats, guidelines and tools could help making more accessibility-focused decisions. Making online contents and activities accessible for people with disabilities according to standards is a step required to guarantee equal access to digital initiatives thus increasing audience engagement for all visitors: websites, conferences platforms, videos, applications documents, social media channels should all be developed and maintained in accordance to accessibility requirements. Subtitles and captions should be implemented in all cases as the choice of the digital platforms should be accessibility-driven.\nLastly, the organization of workshops, seminars and discussion about accessibility for book professionals as well as for generic public could further provide chances for improvement and discussion, especially in regard to the European Accessibility Act.", "The survey represent the first available analysis at EU level on the theme, especially from a qualitative point of view as the most representative European book fairs took part in the research: professional fairs \u2013 Bologna Children\u2019s Book Fair, Frankfurt Book Fair and Liber International Book Fair \u2013 as well as generalist fairs \u2013 Latvian Book Fair, Buch Wien, Vienna International Book Fair, Pi\u00f9 libri pi\u00f9 liberi (Rome), Vilnius Book Fair, Bookfest (Romania), Lisbon Book Fair, Thessaloniki Book Fair, Bokm\u00e4ssan \u2013 G\u00f6teborg Book Fair, Madrid Book Fair, Napoli Citt\u00e0 Libro, International Istanbul Book Fair, Salone Internazionale del Libro di Torino, Book World Prague.\nA structured questionnaire, prepared after a fruitful dialogue with the participants about existing practices, was submitted to each of them to investigate four areas of interest:\n- Awareness;\n- Physical accessibility;\n- Digital communication channels;\n- Initiatives on accessibility both for general public and professionals.", "Book Fairs\u2018 Accessibility Report.

But as one conversation participant put it, \u201cThe biggest deterrent to creating [accessible] online exhibits is not having the expertise and the resources.\u201d One library makes knowledge more widely available by offering office hours with accessibility experts. Another has embedded an assistive technology specialist within the library IT unit.

Others pointed to listservs and interest groups that have sprung up under various organizations, such as the American Library Association\u2019s uniaccess listserv and Educause\u2019s IT Accessibility Community Group. The Web Accessibility Initiative was named as a key resource and potential collaborator. Some suggested the Digital Library Federation, the Digital Public Library of America, and the Museum Computer Network as potential players and rallying points for accessible digital exhibit efforts.\nMany of the systems in use in our libraries do not adequately support accessibility and inclusion", "Recently I hosted a virtual conversation, open to staff at all OCLC Research Library Partnership institutions about creating interactive digital exhibits that are accessible and inclusive. \u201cAccessible and inclusive\u201d in this context means that Web sites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities and learning differences can use them.

Approaches vary, in method and in scope. One library is looking into hiring Web developers trained in accessibility. Another has formed a committee to look at all aspects of creating online content, asking, \u201cHow can we provide that really curated experience while also making it accessible, providing an equal experience for all of our users?\u201d Another participant\u2019s library changed its Web site workflow so that all materials are reviewed for accessibility: \u201cNow we have one main content person who is a content strategist\u2026 We just work with people to edit the content on the Web pages, where they are the subject matter experts, but we\u2019re doing the content editing, to make sure it\u2019s accessible", "Heightening awareness and providing training on the basics of accessibility would go a long way toward addressing the overall challenge: \u201cI think that in addition to training for developers we also need broader training for creators\u2026I think that building greater awareness throughout the institution will be really key. That is also going to help with people understanding the need for resource allocation and time for planning for a project.\u201d Some are already providing basic instruction at their institutions, to those who avail themselves of it: \u201cI teach a workshop on designing accessible and inclusive digital projects\u2026and staff do attend. But, with the inconsistency in knowledge, it can become very challenging\u2026Training staff is a preventative so that, as they move forward, they cease to do things a certain way\u2026Fixing that would go some way toward fixing some of these other problems as well.\u201d", "This idea was universally acknowledged during the session. One participant said, \u201cThere has to be a cultural shift around expectations. I think if you put pressure on\u2026vendors up front, that would make a huge difference in terms of the accessibility.\u201d One library represented on the call has included language in their RFPs stating that any software to be purchased must be vetted by the accessibility office and IT: \u201cAny exception would come with an alternate access plan\u2026and something in writing from the vendor saying that accessibility is on their roadmap.\u201d\nThere is a persistent myth that you sacrifice cool and engaging web design if you embrace accessibility", "Web site accessibility is not an area where OCLC RLP staff have expertise, but we do have the ability to reach out across the OCLC RLP membership and bring together staff at affiliated institutions to address issues and challenges of common interest. Several RLP members have indicated to us that creating accessible interactive digital exhibits is indeed one of those shared challenges.\nHere are our top takeaways from the group conversation.\nWeb accessibility is an emerging challenge requiring specialized skills and knowledge not always readily available to library staff members or to others within the institution.", "Several call participants pushed back passionately against that myth: \u201cThat really is determined by how experienced your developers are in accessible design.

For example, do not send emails with text solely embedded in an image, and ensure your font sizes and colors adhere to accessibility guidelines (Harvard University Information Technology, 2022). Adobe Acrobat has an accessibility check process for PDF documents. The IFAS Communications team can also help review your advertising for accessibility. Submit your PDF, Word, and PowerPoint files to Workfront by making a new request, selecting \u201cUF/IFAS Communications Requests,\u201d and asking for ADA remediation in the subject line. When filling out a simple form, the team will send your request to the right unit, or you can choose \u201cADA Document Accessibility\u201d when filling out a detailed form.

See Example 1 about event advertising.\nSetting Up for the Event", "In the following sections, two examples demonstrate a shorter- and longer-form set of expectations and accessibility features. One important idea includes clearly sharing the access features that are already planned and providing an invitation to make further requests. In the second example, participants were invited to help provide access during the event; see the section, Access Roles, where users could provide audio and sound descriptions, among other things. Each example shares how the event is or is not designed for participation, providing ways to participate actively or passively. The Society of Disabled Oracles (2023) offered participation cards as virtual backgrounds to indicate level of participation.", "Please send us any other accommodation requests upon signing up and we'll do our best to honor them! If you can't make it, we'll send out a recording (if all attendees consent to this) afterwards to all those who register as well as our community members\u201d (Inclusive Design Jam, n.d.).\nExample 2. Society of Disabled Oracles Launch Party\nIn a second example, the Participation Guide from the Society of Disabled Oracles Launch Party in March 2023 demonstrates guidelines shared both before and during the event for participation expectations. The guide also features a section on safety and the methods that event hosts may use to continue ensuring safety from abusive behavior.

Understanding and planning for everyone\u2019s needs will allow you to best serve all clients and participants. For example, lacking access to food and childcare may require people, with or without disabilities, to participate in virtual events rather than in person. However, simply providing a virtual event may not overcome these barriers; you may need to explicitly plan for time for people to eat, or explicitly welcome participants to do so during the event as needed. People with disabilities may need support for another paid caregiver to watch children or others so that participants can engage without distractions. Accommodations such as supporting food and childcare or adding captions and image descriptions are likely to help people without disabilities on top of making full participation possible for those with particular disabilities\u2014this is what\u2019s known as the \u201ccurb-cut effect\u201d (Blackwell, 2017)", "- Create and share a participation guide with information on the event link, agenda, accommodations that will or will not be present, and ways to request additional accommodations (Society of Disabled Oracles, 2023).

Recognize accessibility is a moving goal; needs may change even in the moment, such as when someone has an acute onset of a headache, so an event that starts out accessible to all participants may not remain so throughout its duration. It may be impossible to provide all accommodations at once, as offering some accommodations may actually exclude others. If people, disabled or otherwise, have to search for or ask separately for accommodations, this is already an additional burden on them (phdisabled, 2014). To best alleviate this obstacle, gather information up front about participant needs (Rewa & Hunter, 2020). Also offer multiple ways to engage, such as synchronously and asynchronously, even to the point of facilitating the event multiple times if necessary.\nPlanning the Event", "Both examples also describe the availability of the recording, an example of the \u201ccurb-cut effect\u201d of design that centers access. This effect refers to how the creation of curb cuts, or ramps, at the end of sidewalks for people with mobility disabilities actually benefitted a wide range of users beyond the initial audience, including people pushing strollers, cyclists, skaters, and delivery personnel (Blackwell, 2017). In this case, the much more ubiquitous availability of recording online events makes it more likely that anyone, regardless of access needs, can participate asynchronously. Moreover, event hosts who state up front that recordings will (or will not) be available can cut down on inquiries from potential registrants.\nExample 1. Inclusive Design Jam Event", "- Turn on captions every time, automatically. Figure out how to configure this in your account before your next meeting.\n- Set up your space with lighting that shows the speaker, plain backgrounds, and low ambient audio such as air conditioning (The National Disability Rights Network, n.d.).\n- Use technology features, such as Spotlight and Pin in Zoom or Teams, to make sure your ASL interpreters or other access magicians are kept on-screen even as other speakers come in and out of view, especially in webinar or conference setups (The National Disability Rights Network, n.d.).\n- Review language and style guides for widely accepted language. If you are creating an event focusing on or prioritizing a specific population, ask them their preference on language to be used.\n- Prepare presenters with event guidelines and access guidelines (Shellhouse et al., 2021; Stofer, 2017; Stofer, Hanson, and Hecht, 2023). See Example 2 for an example event guideline for accessibility.", "- At the beginning, go over access features of the event. This includes reviewing the agenda aloud, not simply posting it on a screen (Society of Disabled Oracles, 2023).\n- If you are recording the event, make sure to ask participants for permission. Notify participants what will be recorded, such as only speaker view versus all participants and so forth.\n- Invite participants to add pronouns to their screen names.\n- Set participation guidelines. For example, you may let participants know they should \u201cdisrespect etiquette to respect access\u201d as modeled by the Society of Disabled Oracles\u2019 (2023) launch event. They also planned for the need to regroup in a different room and directed participants to monitor the online participation guide for a new link if one became necessary.\n- Pause at the end of this introduction, allowing people time to set up their virtual environments as needed and to request further access or ask questions.\nDuring the Event", "Stofer, K.

Authors Kit de Waal and Molly Flatt quickly stepped in, starting work on the Big Book Weekend as early as March 2020. This event brought together 28 sessions from cancelled festivals and broadcast them on My Virtual Literary Festival, including appearances from authors such as Neil Gaiman, Juno Dawson, and Booker Prize winner Bernardine Evaristo. The sessions are available on My VLF until the end of April, so make sure you watch them before they\u2019re taken down!", "Long-Running Lockdown Literature", "Some digital book festivals have broken away from the \u201cone week/end\u201d format altogether, and put together extended events programmes that have been running throughout lockdown. Lockdown LitFest has featured interviews with a huge range of authors, running regularly over the past year. The famous Blackwell\u2019s bookshop in Oxford has kept up their roster of stellar literary events, moving them over to Zoom. Cambridge Literary Festival has a timetable of fascinating online events, available to watch live or on catch-up for a couple of days afterwards. Individual authors have been running their own events. Elle McNicoll, author of A Kind of Spark, has been running a YouTube writing class aimed at young readers, while children\u2019s poet Michael Rosen has filled his channel with poetry readings and workshops", ". The World Book Day website has created a series of online masterclasses, great for home education or for writers and illustrators of any age wanting to boost their practice in the face of lockdown creative block. Thanks to modern streaming and video platforms, authors and readers are able to connect in a way that would have been impossible if the pandemic had happened a few years ago.", "The Cons of Digital Book Festivals\nWhile digital book festivals and events have many advantages, there are drawbacks to every medium. While authors have welcomed the opportunity to connect with a wider audience, and to take part in events without the travel time that takes away from their writing, there\u2019s the counterpoint that book sales related to online events can be much lower than those at offline literary festivals. (Blackwell\u2019s is addressing this by offering digital attendees the option to buy a book alongside a ticket to a launch or event). This, combined with the fact that schools may expect to pay less (or nothing) for a digital author event, has led to a significant drop in income for many authors \u2013 the scale of this loss of income can be seen in the fact that the Society of Authors paid out over \u00a31.3 million in hardship funding to authors during 2020.", "Digital events have very different requirements to in-person events, and this is particularly clear when it comes to security. While offline event organisers might be used to setting up guest lists or hiring security professionals, the dangers associated with online events can be much less predictable. An author event run by a Yorkshire-based school was hacked by an outside group who posted explicit sexual content, showing that safeguarding can be a much greater challenge when hosting online events than their offline counterparts. Conversely, online attendees can themselves pose a risk; author Dhonielle Clayton was subjected to racist abuse by students with their video screens turned off during a Zoom author event at a school. While authors can of course face bigoted abuse and harassment at in-person events, the level of anonymity that potential abusers can hide behind during online events means that there is less chance of accountability and consequences for such abuse.", "Digital book festivals have created greater accessibility in many ways, but they\u2019re not a perfect medium, and some accessibility challenges still remain. Captions are not standard across all platforms, making it difficult for Deaf attendees to participate. Participation in digital book festivals depends on having a stable internet connection, something that isn\u2019t a guarantee for every reader (or indeed every author). For some authors and panellists, an online book event might be more draining than an offline one; without the feedback and energy from a room full of readers, even the most dynamic digital event can feel jarring.\nGoing Forward", "While online book festivals and events are still in their early days, and have gone through a few teething troubles, they\u2019ve filled the gap left by the cancellation of so many offline festivals following the COVID-19 pandemic. I hope that, as we get vaccinated and the world starts to open up again, we manage to bring online and offline festivals together. I miss the buzz and special-occasion feel of offline festivals, but having a digital festival running alongside an offline one would open up attendance to a much wider range of people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise be able to attend. Digital book festivals have been sparks of joy in a long period of lockdown, and I\u2019m immensely glad that so many authors, organisers and book lovers have stepped up to keep them going during this very strange time.", "For a look back at offline book festivals, check out one Rioter\u2019s post on Why You Should Go To Book Festivals.

International Book Fairs Go Virtual: How Amazon Publishing ...", "snippets": ["Perhaps you can imagine my shock when, just a few weeks later, Covid-19 began to spread, and plans for the London Book Fair were cancelled. Our meticulous tracker representing months of work might as well have gone up in smoke. In those early days before flights were grounded and offices hadn\u2019t sent folks home yet, my first concern was for our authors\u2014if I couldn\u2019t get to London to pitch their books to our network in person, would international publishers choose other books instead? As the crisis heightened and travel restrictions were adopted around the world, my concern shifted to our community\u2019s safety, not to mention everyone\u2019s livelihoods as bookstores, printing houses, and offices shut down. And my own team was suddenly faced with the stark question of how to sell a product during a pandemic.", "With the pandemic still unresolved, my team will not have a physical presence at the book fairs we typically attend every fall in Frankfurt, Germany, and Guadalajara, Mexico. We still have a shared tracker, and I still check it obsessively, but now it\u2019s focused on preparations for virtual events and ideas to stay meaningfully connected even when we are apart. For example, at our annual Frankfurt presentation for our subagents (who represent translation rights to Amazon Publishing titles in over 30 territories) we typically gather at the iconic Steigenberger Frankfurter Hof Hotel, and serve apple strudel, perfect for the crisper days of autumn. This year, to keep the tradition alive virtually, I shared my family\u2019s apple strudel recipe, inviting everyone to bake and share a picture of themselves with it, which we will feature in our virtual presentation", "With a certain amount of trepidation, we decided we\u2019d host a webinar to bring our network together and present our books and authors virtually. In many industries, webinars are routine, but book publishing culture is typically intertwined with real life interaction: cocktail parties, readings, long lunches, meetings over coffee and cake. In addition to book fairs, international rights opportunities are also driven by fellowships and workshops, where publishing professionals from around the world are invited to visit a country and meet with local publishers; in-person connection is always a focal point. In a group presentation, there\u2019s no opportunity for the back-and-forth that is the essence of these meetings; the banter that forms the foundation of our relationships with one another, and establishes our \u201cjoint sensibilities", "I spend every February entrenched in preparations for the London Book Fair, framed by shelves full of translated books and stacks of catalogs at my desk at Amazon Publishing\u2019s New York City office. As our Global Rights Director, I lead a team attending multiple book fairs each year, where we hold speed-dating style meetings with publishers from around the world, presenting books and authors for them to consider for publication. We start preparing for each fair months in advance, maintaining a shared tracker of every task that needs to be accomplished, with an owner and deadline assigned to each one. Even though 2020 was to be my seventh year at the London Book Fair and I could recite every aspect of our preparations from memory, I reviewed and updated this document with what is probably (OK, definitely) neurotic frequency", "If you are an international publisher or literary scout, we\u2019d love to invite you to our webinar; you can e-mail our Global Rights team at globalrights@amazon.com to request more information.", ". But I certainly don\u2019t believe that virtual outreach will replace the experience of meeting in person, where an impromptu exchange of \u201cjoint sensibilities\u201d may lead you to unexpected places. Walking into a book fair, being surrounded by thousands of people from around the world who all make a career out of publishing books, makes me feel alive. It grounds me in the reason I wake up and open my laptop every morning; it reminds me what I work towards during the rest of the year. I cannot wait for the moment when I can go back to creating my team\u2019s tracker for an in-person book fair, and when a pipe dream is once again my reality.", "Of course, Hatty\u2019s suggestion was perfect\u2014rather than making an assumption about what our community needed from us, we should ask them, as we would have if we were to meet in person. Typing out these messages gave me a renewed sense of purpose, and the replies we received were deeply moving, providing snapshots of life during Covid-19 in their communities, local industry, or workplaces, creating a shared vision of how the pandemic was spreading across the globe. While much of what we heard was very sad and scary, many people mentioned how books have remained a source of comfort. On even the most difficult days, our fellow book lovers in the international rights community wanted to keep reading, and we felt encouraged to stay in touch with them about our titles.", "\u201cI think we should put a pause on reaching out to our contacts to pitch books,\u201d I said dejectedly over a video conference with Hatty. I knew as I said it that this would be completely antithetical to the whole purpose of our jobs, not to mention everything I most love about our work, adding an additional layer of sadness to the anxiety I was already feeling about the pandemic. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel right to be trying to secure deals when everyone is worried about their survival.\u201d\nHatty\u2019s face on my screen grew contemplative amidst her neutral, soothing background of plants, books, a lamp, and a piano. \u201cWhat if we reach out to some members of our community to ask them how they\u2019re doing and how we can support them?\u201d she suggested wisely. \u201cThen, depending on what we learn from them, we can decide how best to accommodate their needs.\u201d", ". On the other hand, the event was efficient, allowing us to present Amazon Publishing books and authors to a large international network over the course of an hour, instead of through multiple days of individual, back-to-back meetings. And publishers who do not normally attend book fairs or with whom we hadn\u2019t met in the past had the opportunity to join us, helping us build new relationships. The webinar filled me with hope, rejuvenating my sense of connection to the rights community that had been shattered by the pandemic. Our inboxes were soon full of rights leads, as they are after a book fair. Having the opportunity to connect with so many members of the international rights community from my home office, wallpaper and all, reinforced how meaningful our work is. Despite the challenges faced around the world, there was still interest in bringing new books to new readers\u2014an important lifeline I could continue to rely on during a time full of unknowns.", ". We\u2019ll be hosting another webinar\u2014we\u2019re offering three sessions, on September 30, October 6, and October 13\u2014we\u2019re scheduling one-on-one virtual meetings to connect with our network, and we\u2019ve created video presentations for a selection of Amazon Publishing titles for anyone who can\u2019t join us. After the great results of our initial outreach, I\u2019ve become energized by the challenge of connecting virtually\u2014it can be fun to experiment with new ways to reach our community online, as with the apple strudel\u2014and I\u2019m grateful that connection of any form is still possible during these dangerous times. We may decide to continue to create new virtual content as a way to reach our community throughout the year, when we\u2019re not at book fairs; I\u2019ve been learning new skills that may guide me into this future, such as how to self-record a pitch video", "International Book Fairs Go Virtual: How Amazon Publishing Is Innovating to Connect with Global Publishers", "Our correspondence with our international publishing community reflected just how much people are a key element of what makes my job so special. As sad as it was, hearing from so many people across the world who were all grappling alongside me with these unprecedented, terrifying times, and remained unified through their shared love of books, also filled me with a sense of solidarity that I desperately needed while we were all apart. It reinforced the power of the connection that is the essence of my team\u2019s work: the moment when we match books and authors with international publishers. I\u2019ve always loved hearing from authors about how exciting it is to imagine readers in a country they\u2019ve never visited reacting to their stories, or to hold a copy of their own book in a language they can\u2019t read. Sometimes an author will have a special connection to a certain country\u2014maybe they or their family lived there, it\u2019s a favorite place to visit, or they have loved ones who speak the language", "We hosted two identical sessions in the late spring, to accommodate a range of time zones. Publishers, literary scouts, and agents from 33 countries RSVP\u2019d, sharing greetings in the chat when they signed on: \u201cHello, greetings from Poland,\u201d \u201cHello from Germany!\u201d \u201cHello from Oslo!\u201d \u201cHi from Tokyo\u201d \u201cHi from Brazil\u201d \u201cHi from Taipei\u201d \u201cHi from Holland\u201d \u201cHi from Sweden\u201d. There were some aspects of this event that were very strange\u2014for one, to avoid connectivity issues, we asked everyone to mute their microphones, keep their videos turned off, and type any questions or feedback into the chat. Presenting to a faceless void was awkward; it made me think of my favorite yoga teacher, and how they invited students to turn on our cameras during virtual classes\u2014now I could really understand why. It was difficult to pitch books without being able to see the audience or interpret their reactions", ". Crossing things off our list filled me with anticipation, bringing me one step closer to the day in March when I\u2019d board the plane for London armed with my pitching notes and my Kindle loaded with newly delivered manuscripts. Not only are book fairs one of the cornerstones of the international rights business, they\u2019re also the highlights of my year, more meaningful to me than most holidays.", ". We\u2019re in touch with our network of publishers, agents, and literary scouts throughout the year to create these opportunities for authors, of course, but the centerpiece of our interactions is when we reunite face-to-face at book fairs. After years of exchanging opinions about books and reading, you begin to form natural bonds that lead to the relationships Lewis-Kraus described; I look forward to these business meetings as one might reunions with old friends. And just like with friends, it felt especially right to lean into connection with this community during hard times, too.", "When I first learned about book fairs, I was 22-years-old, a lifelong book lover, and brand new to publishing, working as an assistant at the Wylie Agency. One of my tasks was to help create the agency\u2019s catalog of the books and authors presented at the fairs. A robust bound volume of a few hundred pages, this was the agents\u2019 primary tool for pitching books, and it had to be completed on a strict deadline to arrive at their stand on time. These catalogs and the flurry of activity that buzzed through the agency before and after each fair were all I knew of book fairs until I happened to read Gideon Lewis-Kraus\u2019s article, \u201cThe Last Book Party,\u201d in Harper\u2019s, which I devoured online at my desk in the hallway, over a homemade lunch of leftover vegetables, interrupted periodically to transfer calls or take messages for the agent I assisted", ". I speak a bit of Spanish, so I conduct many of my meetings with Spanish-language publishers in this language, as our Senior Rights Manager, Hatty Stiles, who speaks Italian, does with Italian publishers. While preparing for these meetings, I often learn new vocabulary tied to the books I\u2019m pitching, which enhances my appreciation of the art of translation, and my admiration for my international rights colleagues who speak to me in their second languages. All these years later, I catch myself thinking back to the moment I read Lewis-Kraus\u2019s article every time I get ready to attend another book fair, grateful that what once felt like a pipe dream became my reality.", "Today, now that attending the international book fairs is such a key part of my job, I know the truth of that Harper\u2019s essay: these face-to-face conversations can lead to powerful connections, organic revelations, and lasting relationships. I\u2019m always moved to realize that one of my favorite authors\u2019 words also resonate with someone from another part of the world, even though we may be reading them in different languages. Sometimes a seemingly casual side conversation will become an important opportunity: a German editor once mentioned to me in passing that she\u2019d love a book like Gilmore Girls, and I realized I had the perfect one, which she went on to acquire. Or maybe I\u2019ll learn that my counterpart shares my love of yoga, or dogs, or running, and from this common ground we\u2019ll not only find books to work on together but also forge a friendship", ".\u201d Furthermore, I was fraught with other worries: Would the technology break down or be difficult for our contacts to use? Would something embarrassing happen? And of course, the crux of the project: would it be effective for our business?", "We settled down to answer this question from our new home offices, peering into each other\u2019s spaces via video conference as we brainstormed how to address this crisis. The wall behind my desk is accented with quirky, duck-egg blue wallpaper in a pattern of deer skulls and antlers, which frames my face on video calls; I never imagined that so many of my colleagues around the world would see it when I put it up. Despite my cheery surroundings, I felt despondent as we considered how to navigate the situation; with their health, safety, and livelihoods at stake, would anyone even want to hear about books? Book fairs began to feel like a pipe dream again.", ". I was bowled over by Lewis-Kraus\u2019s magical description of international publishing industry representatives who have developed \u201cwhat\u2019s constantly described as a familial relationship\u201d founded on a shared taste and appreciation for books, or a \u201chistory of joint sensibilities.\u201d He describes having dinner next to publishers from a dozen countries, who share the same authors in their local languages, and of strolling past booths featuring books from Russia, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Japan, Turkey, and Romania\u2014so many places I\u2019d never been.
